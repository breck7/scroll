📦 170.2.0 2/11/2025
🎉 Added an optional filename(s) param to scroll `build`, `format`, and `test` commands
 - For large projects like PLDB, it can be helpful to build/test/format 1 file via cli.
 - I've resisted cli parameters to encourage simplicity but it was time to relax this one ;).

📦 170.1.1 2/11/2025
🏥 buildTxt was stripping HTML in places where it should have been kept.
 - still had some legacy behavior from before we had individual buildTxt methods.

Usage shows users expect HTML to just work in Scroll, so I am moving all Scroll cues with namespace conflicts to new available words and adding all HTML cues as parsers.

This release moves `table` to `datatable`, so now `table` refers to the HTML element.

To upgrade, just rename all uses of `table` to `datatable`. Or you can always just add an alias Parser if you don't want to do that for some reason.

📦 101.0.0 7/03/2024
This is a major breaking release meant to simplify and standardize a lot of the core Scroll concepts.
🎉 added `buildHtml` parser
🎉 added `buildRss` parser
🎉 you no longer need to write `importOnly` on a file if the file uses no buildCommandParsers.
⚠️ BREAKING: `snippets` => `printSnippets`
⚠️ BREAKING: `fullSnippets` => `printFullSnippets`
⚠️ BREAKING: `buildText` => `buildTxt`
⚠️ BREAKING: `scroll build` will no longer write anything by default. You now need to explicitly include 1 or more buildCommands in your files, such as `buildHtml` or `buildTxt`.
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `tags` parser in css themes. Instead of this:

code
 permalink style.css
 gazetteCss
  tags false
Do this:

code
 buildCss style.css
 gazetteCss

📦 100.0.0 7/02/2024
🎉 if not present, `date` is now derived from file creation time
🎉 if not present, `title` is now computed by un-camelcasing the filename
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) date and title are now computed automatically so if you had a file missing those previously on purpose (for some reason), they will now actually have those.

📦 99.2.0 7/01/2024
🎉 added changes.parsers
🎉 Scrollsets now supports defining concept delimiters other than `id`

sparkline 5 7 27 87 300 17 10 5

📦 97.0.0 6/19/2024
🎉 BREAKING: upgraded scrollSDK to get `grammar` to `parsers` change.

📦 96.0.0 6/18/2024
🎉 Instead of `grammar` it's just `parsers`.

📦 95.2.0 6/16/2024
🎉 added `formatAndSave` method.

📦 95.1.0 6/14/2024
🎉 added `wws` command line app.

📦 95.0.0 6/11/2024
🎉 added `downloadUrl` parser.

⚠️ BREAKING: `homeLink` is now `homeUrl`.

📦 94.0.1 6/1/2024
🏥 make slideshow start after the first dinkus

📦 94.0.0 5/31/2024
🎉 jtree is now the "ScrollSDK" and "Tree Notation" is now "Particles"
⚠️ BREAKING: (only advanced users affected), if you wrote custom Parsers, you may need to find/replace `jtree` with `scrollsdk`

📦 93.7.1 5/30/2024
🏥 katex should print contents in txt compilation

📦 93.7.0 5/29/2024
🎉 added `classes` parser

📦 93.1.0 5/23/2024
🎉 `tableSearch` now will save the sort order to the url
🏥 fixed bug where updates to externals would not get copied

📦 93.0.0 5/21/2024
🎉 `scroll format` command now also prettifies concepts and measurements in ScrollSets. If a measurement's `sortIndex` jumps to a new integer (for example, 1.9 to 2.1), a newline will be inserted before it.
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) the default `sortIndex` is now 1.9, and the sort index of `id` is 1.0. Update `sortIndex` accordingly.

📦 92.0.0 5/20/2024
🎉 simplified ScrollSets by removing the filename "magic". When putting a concept into a file, make the `id` the filename (without the extension). Have the id be a simple one atom url friendly string. If you want a pretty title, add a `name` measure. Everything much simpler this way.
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) remove any spaghetti filename code.

📦 91.0.0 5/19/2024
🎉 `printAuthor` parser prints the author defined by `author`. `byLine` has been deprecated--replace with `printAuthor`.
⚠️ BREAKING: `author` parser now takes a URL.

📦 90.5.0 5/19/2024
🎉 added `printDate` parser

📦 90.4.1 5/19/2024

🏥 `Coverage` in Measurements should round down.

📦 90.2.2 5/18/2024

📦 90.2.1 5/18/2024
🏥 fixed `metaTags` from breaking try.scroll.pub
🏥 got `slideshow` working on try.scroll.pub

📦 90.2.0 5/18/2024
🎉 added `slideshow` parser
🎉 grammar extensions can now use "copyFromExternal"

📦 90.1.1 5/17/2024

📦 90.1.0 5/17/2024
🎉 2.5x faster test running thanks to adding cacheing to measure parser

📦 90.0.0 5/16/2024
⚠️ BREAKING: `idParser` and `filenameParser` no longer ship in default grammar. This will allow for useful future dataset features. Instead, add them yourself if you are using Concepts like this:

code
 idParser
  extends abstractIdParser
 filenameParser
  extends abstractFilenameParser

📦 89.2.1 5/16/2024
🏥 fixed required measurements when computeds are involved
🎉 print folder name when running scroll test

📦 89.2.0 5/16/2024
🎉 added support for required measurements

📦 89.1.2 5/16/2024

📦 89.1.1 5/16/2024
🏥 minor fix in themes grammar.

📦 89.1.0 5/15/2024
🎉 added ability to override content in `printTitle`

📦 89.0.0 5/15/2024
🎉 `printTitle` parser added for easier templates
⚠️ BREAKING: `title` is now a setter. This regex handles the migration:
 - `^title ` `printTitle\ntitle `
  - Then (optionally) run "scroll format" or "scroll list | scroll format" to format which will automove your titles up top.

📦 88.0.0 5/15/2024
🎉 easier snippets! if you have a dinkus anywhere "***|****|---", that will be used as an "endSnippet"
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected). If you had a post that purposefully had no `endSnippet` and does have a dinkus, it will now generate a snippet rather than using the whole post.

📦 87.0.1 5/15/2024
🏥 fixed off by 1 bug in computed measures

📦 87.0.0 5/14/2024
⚠️ BREAKING: added stricter conventions for `measureNames`. Restrict them from containing "_", which we use to combine nested measures.

📦 86.0.2 5/12/2024
🏥 add relative paths to sitemaps if needed

📦 86.0.1 5/12/2024
🏥 improved test coverage

📦 86.0.0 5/12/2024
🎉 added a v1 version of a markdown style of doing quotes `>` (with aftertext support)!
🎨 made the View Source links have same style as other Scroll chrome, and removed those links in short snippet renders (never get needed there--only on the actual page)
⚠️ BREAKING: if you have any lines starting with `> `, those will now be parsed by the quickQuoteParser

📦 85.9.0 5/12/2024
🎉 added `minutes` to read (assuming 200 atoms/minute) to `printSearch` and `printCsv` exports
🎉 you can now pass groups to `sitemap` for making sitemaps specific to certain folders/groups
🎉 for `printFeed`, `snippets`, `fullSnippets` providing groups is now optional

📦 85.8.0 5/10/2024
🎉 measures and concepts can now also be written as Javascript for explore pages.

📦 85.7.0 5/10/2024
🎉 `replaceJs` now has access to the filepath

📦 85.6.0 5/10/2024
🎉 `sortBy` can now sort on multiple columns and handle asc/desc

📦 85.5.0 5/10/2024
🎉 `writeConcepts` and `writeMeasures` can now take multiple filenames in one line and also include a `sortBy` condition.

📦 85.4.0 5/10/2024
🎉 Scroll now auto-adds a "filename" measure as to which file the concept appears in.

📦 85.3.0 5/10/2024
🎉 Scroll now only wraps compiler output with html tags if permalink ends in "html" or "htm". Makes it easier to use Scroll to compile files to different language targets.

📦 85.2.1 5/10/2024
🏥 fixed bug where `id` measure was appearing twice

📦 85.2.0 5/10/2024
🏥 fixed bug with nested measure names.

📦 85.0.0 5/08/2024
🎉 upgraded jtree to get ability for faster compilations
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `replaceDefault` parser. No one should be affected.
⚠️ BREAKING: renamed `nodejs` parser to `replaceNodejs. Few should be affected.

📦 84.10.1 5/08/2024
🏥 fix hanging test (infinite loop regression) during build when you have just 1 file.

📦 84.10.0 5/08/2024
🎉 faster html generation when `keyboardNav` was in use. First implementation was accidentally quadratic.

📦 84.9.0 5/08/2024
🎉 faster concepts and measures compilation

📦 84.8.1 5/07/2024
🏥 `printSearchTable` now generates correct links when searching across multiple folders

📦 84.8.0 5/07/2024
🎉 `tableSearch` now takes a parameter from the url `#q=[search]`. Updating the searching box also updates url.

📦 84.7.0 5/07/2024
🎉 Added `printSearchTable` parser

📦 84.6.0 5/07/2024
🎉 Added support for computed measures
🎉 better measure statistics printing

📦 84.5.1 5/07/2024
🏥 better error printing with `scroll test` and fix bug in `percentAtom`

📦 84.5.0 5/07/2024
🎉 Added `writeMeasures` and `printMeasures` parsers
🎉 Added `abstractPercentageMeasureParser`

📦 84.4.0 5/06/2024
🎉 Added `loadConcepts` parser for if you had a dataset split into many files in a folder.
🎉 Added `float sortIndex [int]` for sorting the measures(columns) in dataset generation. Lower sort indexes come first.

📦 84.3.0 5/06/2024
🎉 `scroll test` will now report if an aftertext pattern has no matches.

📦 84.2.0 5/06/2024
🎉 added `****` as an "end of post dinkus" which prints ⁂
🎉 tabular tables now support aftertext!
🏥 allow multiatom strings to be used as an `id` in concepts

📦 84.1.0 5/04/2024
🎉 snippets now export some content in plain text
🎉 improved the default site generated by `scroll init`

📦 84.0.0 5/04/2024
🎉 Datasets (aka "Concept files") version 2! Much simpler.
🎉 Added the `id` parser for using datasets.
🎉 Removed the `[measureName]: ` syntax introduced in version 77. You no longer have to worry about the annoyance that introduced when writing a paragraph such as "Sidenote: yada yada".
🎉 Added `belowAsCodeUntil` parser

⚠️ BREAKING: removed `::` parser. Now concepts are simply identified by the parser `id`.
⚠️ BREAKING: `writeDataset` is now `writeConcepts` and `printDataset` is now `printConcepts`.
⚠️ BREAKING: Removed the `[measureName]: ` syntax introduced in version 77. To use datasets (aka Concept files) now, just extend Scroll parsers like you normally would. See this blog post for an example.
 blog/datasets.html this blog post for an example

📦 83.3.0 5/04/2024
🎉 repeating the baseUrl after `openGraphImage` is no longer required. Will be auto-added if not present.

📦 83.2.0 5/04/2024
🎉 added `link` under `image`. Also added `target`.
🎉 for posts with multiple images, you can now put `openGraph` under an `image` node as an alternative to adding a separate `openGraphImage` line
🎉 added `mediumColumns` parser
🎉 added `thinColumns` parser.

* Note: `startColumns` will eventually be removed. You can now safely switch those to `thinColumns`.

📦 83.1.0 5/03/2024
🎉 added `expander` parser

expander Click me
Anything in the section will show up here. A blank line ends a section.

📦 83.0.0 5/03/2024
🎉 all tables now print in plain text outputs
🎉 added `printTable` parser
⚠️ BREAKING: root level tabular tables no longer produce output. Add a `printTable [index]` to print any existing tabular tables.

`printTable` will look for a table to print using this strategy:
- If an index is provided, print that table.
- Else, is there a table right below this line?
- Else, is there a table right before this line?
- Else, print the first table in the file.

📦 82.2.0 5/03/2024
🎉 pruned more files from `npm install`

📦 82.1.0 5/03/2024
🎉 pruned dependencies to make `npm install -g scroll-cli --production` fast

📦 82.0.1 5/01/2024
🏥 fixed regression where `endSnippet` was showing up in html

📦 82.0.0 5/01/2024
🎉 meta tags can now have nested comments
🎉 added `formatCommand` to the CLI for nicely formatting files, moving top matter to the top, cleaning up white space, etc, so you don't have to worry about that.
🎉 plain text files now will have a maximum of 2 blank lines in a row
🎉 plain text files now print date, if there's a dateline

The current formatting conventions are:

- Scroll files end in a single newline
- Trailing spaces and tabs are stripped from lines, unless the whole line is whitespace
- `importOnly`, if present, is moved to the very top
- 3 or more newlines are trimmed down to 2
- Meta tags are moved to the top of the file
- 2 newlines comes after meta tags
- Tags that print content and comments stay put
- Meta tags are sorted alphabetically with no blank lines in between [In the future, may want to allow customizing this]

Note that currently the `title` tag is a meta tag and a tag that prints content. Going to split that up into 2 tags soon.
Note that if you are doing something like a tutorial and using a `belowAsCode` where you purposely put a top matter parser not at the top, it will currently get moved to the top by format. We can probably add a feature like treating meta nodes with `// noFormat` as if they were content nodes.

📦 81.2.0 4/30/2024
🎉 added `related` and `relatedList` parsers

📦 81.1.0 4/29/2024
🎉 added `plainTextOnly` for rare case when you need to include content only for the plain text version.
🏥 `html` should not print in text versions (since it is _html_ :)).

📦 81.0.0 4/29/2024
🏥 links now appear in plain text output. relative links are made absolute.
🏥 indented lists now appear in plain text output.

⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) if you extended the `thoughtParser`, that is now called `paragraphParser`.

📦 80.2.1 4/29/2024
🏥 fixed regression in tabular tables printing
// a hint that we should refactor that and make all table printing explicit :)

📦 80.2.0 4/29/2024
🎉 added `helpfulNotFound` parser for better 404s.

📦 80.1.0 4/29/2024
🎉 `wordCount` in `printCsv` now measures wordCount in the text version of a post.

📦 80.0.0 4/29/2024
🎉 Scroll now generates text files! Added the `writeText` parser.
 blog/textFiles.html Scroll now generates text files

* Note: there are likely to be a few rapid releases to refine this.

📦 79.1.0 4/27/2024
🎉 added `printSiteMap` parser for text sitemap generation.

📦 79.0.1 4/27/2024
🏥 fix npm issue

📦 79.0.0 4/27/2024
🎉 better offline builds: if used, katex, tableSearch, and maps now copy their needed css and js into their folder and those assets are served locally rather than through CDN.
⚠️ BREAKING: you may need to make some slight updates, such as adding the copied files to .gitignore.

📦 78.0.2 4/27/2024
🏥 open graph image url fix: remove the extra "/" which caused images not to show in Twitter

📦 78.0.1 4/26/2024
🏥 style fix: ensure column splits don't separate images from their captions

📦 78.0.0 4/25/2024
🎉 made tabular data a root level parser in Scroll.
⚠️ BREAKING: if you had lines with tabs that currently match the catchall paragraph, you'll need to make those explicit paragraphs to avoid them getting parsed by the tabular data parser. You should be able to find those lines with a regex like this: `^(\t|[^ ]+\t)`

Spreadsheets are great tools for working with tabular data. I want to copy/paste between Scroll docs and spreadsheets. This makes it easier.

Tabular data is better than line orientation for experimental data because it requires half the number of tokens and it's more efficient eye movement during comparisons and proofreading.

Scroll already supported tabular data using `tabTable`, but that made copy/paste workflows between spreadsheets and text editors a pain. This should be more ergonomic and make it easier to work with this useful tool of thought.

📦 77.3.1 4/23/2024
🏥 style fix: fixed style bug where on narrow screens the post title would overlap the corner nav buttons.

📦 77.3.0 4/22/2024
🎨 updated presentation of footnotes

📦 77.2.0 4/22/2024
🎨 improved default table styles

📦 77.1.0 4/21/2024
🎉 Simplified datasets further after user tests.

📦 77.0.0 4/21/2024
🎉 Added Scroll Datasets, which consists of the `::`, `printDataset`, `writeDataset`, and `*:` and `*::` parsers.
 blog/datasets.html Scroll Datasets

⚠️ BREAKING: if you had lines starting with a atom then colon, that used the catchall paragraph, such as `Sidenote: yada yada.`, those will now be parsed incorrectly as measures. Just explicitly make them paragraphs `* Sidenote: yada yada.`. This regex can help you find any instances: `^[^ ]+: .`

📦 76.0.0 4/19/2024
🎨 try using "rem" in CSS to better support the "zooming out" effect on a blog

The code below added to a page will create the zoom out effect:

code
 css html {font-size: var(--scrollBaseFontSize, 8px);}

⚠️ BREAKING: There might be some slight style breaks related to this change.

📦 75.2.1 4/18/2024
🏥 style fix: removed top margin on headers when they are in the first section

📦 75.2.0 4/18/2024
🎨 increased the default font-size from 14px to 16px
🎨 changed the font-family and line height of captions which previously looked off
🎨 adjusted margins on question h4s
🏥 fix slight line-height issue with datelines

📦 75.1.1 4/16/2024
🏥 fix bug where quick links could not be used inside a footnote definition.

📦 75.1.0 4/10/2024
🎉 Added `***` parser to print a Dinkus
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus Dinkus

belowAsCode 6

Now I will show an example.

***

Above is a dinkus.

📦 75.0.0 4/06/2024
🏥 Revert version 74. There was a simpler way to fix that pattern.

📦 74.0.0 4/06/2024
- (Reverted)

📦 73.2.0 4/05/2024
🎉 added `thanksTo` parser

🎉 added `plainText` parser
🎉 added `printSource` parser to be able to dump the source code for a group of posts to a plain text file.

📦 73.0.0 4/03/2024
🎉 added `printCsv` parser to make it as easy to generate a CSV of a blog as it is to generate an RSS feed

📦 72.4.4 2/07/2024
🏥 do not print "undefined" in tables in rows missing columns

📦 72.4.3 11/04/2023
🏥 fix extra indentation in nested lists. Browser already adds it.

📦 72.4.2 11/04/2023
🏥 do not compile aftertext nodes having the "hidden" attribute

📦 72.4.1 11/04/2023
🏥 fixed regression where `<!DOCTYPE html>` was present in RSS pages. Thank you to Joao for the report.

📦 72.4.0 6/27/2023
🎉 provide "dropcap" CSS class.
🎉 tweaked default styling of images and captions

This paragraph has a dropcap. It can be a useful visual aid for the reader to break up sections. You can read more about dropcaps on Wikipedia.
 addClass dropcap
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial dropcaps on Wikipedia

📦 72.3.0 6/13/2023
🎉 if you want to disable `wrapsOn` you can now provide parameters to specify only the wraps you want, if any.
🏥 by default katex wraps won't run unless there is a `katex` node in a file. So any paragraph containing multiple $ will now behave as before katex wraps were added.

📦 72.2.0 5/31/2023
🎉 added `wideColumns` parser

📦 72.1.0 5/26/2023
🏥 Bold and italics are no longer parsed inside inline code `2*4*2` or inline $\KaTeX$ $X_{2_i}$.

📦 72.0.0 5/25/2023
🎉 added support for inline $\TeX$ via $\KaTeX$.
 - Current implementation requires adding at least one `katex` node in your file and will load the KaTeX code.

katex

📦 71.5.0 5/19/2023
🎉 added support for extra newlines between items in ordered lists
🎉 added support for custom footnote labels and move footnote link to end with new style

🏥 add `&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;` to improve performance on Google Lighthouse.
🏥 fix regression of meta description generation and add test
🏥 upgrade JTree to get colorized test output

📦 71.1.0 5/07/2023
🏥 add `&lt;html lang&gt;&lt;/html&gt;` back as you need that to get proper hyphenation. Added test.
🎉 added `htmlLang` parser for overriding the default lang which is set to "en"
🎉 added `text-align: justify;` on paragraphs to Gazette and Tufte themes.

📦 71.0.0 5/06/2023
🎉 added `tufteCss` beta theme.
🎉 added `###`, `####` and `#####` headers.
⚠️ BREAKING: slight changes to the h1-h4 font sizes and margins in the default gazetteTheme.
 - A single # is now h1, ## is h2, et cetera. `title` can be thought of as `h0`.
⚠️ BREAKING: `gazetteHeader` is now `pageHeader` and `gazetteFooter` is now `pageFooter`. Headers and footers can be independent of themes.

📦 70.0.0 4/29/2023
🎉 Paragraphs no longer need to start with '* '. All non-blank lines that don't start with a defined parser are now treated as a paragraph. The catch-all is no longer an error. It is recommended to start all paragraphs with a capital letter, as in the future it may become the standard that parsers start with a lowercase or symbol, and you will avoid any future parser collisions.
 - Thanks to zoeartemis for the feedback.
 - No changes are needed but you can update your files with the find/replace combo: `\n\* ` `\n`.
  - You may want to use the case sensitive `\n\* [a-z]` search first to find any paragraphs that start with a lowercase letter.
  - You also want to be careful of any lines that would now start with `&lt;!`, as they will be parsed as HTML nodes.

🏥 cache hotfix for embedded snippets.

📦 63.0.0 3/27/2023
This was a big internal refactor to remove the outdated concept of `ScrollFolder` and rely on the file system parameter instead. This makes it easier to build webapps serving dynamic Scroll pages. It also simplifies the upcoming isomorphic release.
⚠️ BREAKING: Only users using Scroll as a module may be affected:
 - Removed `ScrollFolder`. Exports now include `ScrollDiskFileSystem` and `ScrollInMemoryFileSystem`. To get the same behavior as `new ScrollFolder("folder").buildFiles()` use `new ScrollDiskFileSystem().buildFilesInFolder("folder")`.
 - Instead of `new ScrollFolder(__dirname).defaultScrollCompiler` use `DefaultScrollCompiler`
⚠️ BREAKING: Only users using Scroll extensions may be affected:
 - In extensions `compileSnippet` should now be `compileEmbeddedVersion`

🏥 if there is no `permalink` on a file the `title` node won't output an a tag
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected). If you had put markup directives in your title tags, such as *bolds*, those will now actually be evaluated.
⚠️ BREAKING: `title` blocks now start a section like `#` and `##`, so you may need to add an empty line to end the section, for example if you previously had a `startColumns` right after the title tag.

📦 56.1.0 2/8/2023
🎉 `snippets` nodes can now accept multiple groups and also groups can be in different folders. Syntax is `[folderPath]/[groupName]` For example:

Or alias it:

bashCode

You can add the following code to the page(s) you are working on to have them reload without manually refreshing the browser:

scrollCode
 html <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1;">

📦 54.1.0 1/19/2023
🏥 `scroll init` no longer starts with a `viewSourceBaseUrl`. If not provided then the View Source link is to the scroll file, so new sites don't start with broken links.

📦 54.0.0 1/19/2023
🎉 `link` nodes can now have `target`. This link will open in blank tab.

🏥 Upgrade JTree.

📦 52.0.0 1/10/2023
🎉 API usage: new getter `buildNeeded` returns whether the folder needs to be rebuilt. You can use this to skip unnecessary builds for faster perf.
⚠️ BREAKING: This should not break anyone however behavior has changed. `scroll build` now does not overwrite unmodified files. Now `mtime` reflects when the generated HTML last changed instead of when the `scroll build` command was last run. This speeds up `rsync` deploys.

📦 51.0.0 1/9/2023
🎉 This version introduces the concept of `Sections`. Headers (`#`, `##` and `?`) now start a section, and a blank line ends it. A section will not be split across columns.

🏥 fixed body padding regression

📦 47.0.0 11/28/2022
This is a major breaking refactor. Scroll now generates flat html. This release is NOT recommended for the feint of heart. Wait a day or two until the bugs are ironed out.

⚠️ BREAKING: removed automatic meta tag generation. You now need to explicitly add a `metaTags` parser.
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `<!doctype>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. Unnecessary. Modern browsers don't need them. HTML never should have had head/body split.
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `SCROLL_CSS` export.

🏥 `stump` parser works now

📦 46.1.0 11/27/2022

This is a major breaking refactor. *All the implicit imports are gone*. Everything must be explicitly included now (perhaps with a few slight exceptions like meta tags). This migration guide is a work in progress. This release is NOT recommended for the feint of heart. Wait a day or two until the bugs are ironed out.

⚠️ BREAKING: removed `maxColumns` and `columnWidth` and `template`
⚠️ BREAKING: headers and footers are not provided by default. You now must explicitly include them with `scrollHeader` and `scrollFooter`. The previous behavior of `scrollHeader` and `scrollFooter` has been removed.
⚠️ BREAKING: columns are not provided by default. You now need to wrap your content in `startColumns` and `endColumns`.
⚠️ BREAKING: CSS is not included by default. You need to use the snippet parser `scrollCssTag`. The previous behavior of `scrollCss` has been removed. Also `printScrollCss` is now `scrollCss`.

📦 45.0.0 11/24/2022
🎉 a whole new way to do footnotes/end notes.

⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) slim chance linkify may insert links where you previously did not want them.

📦 42.0.0 11/09/2022

⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) `caption` now extends the thought (`*`) node.

blog/screenshot.png

📦 39.0.0 11/03/2022
⚠️ BREAKING: `scroll init` no longer creates a `feed.xml` file by default. You can easily add an XML feed manually with the 2 steps below:

⚠️ BREAKING: Removed support for 🔗 links. Regex [search replace] to upgrade: ` ([^ ]+)🔗([^ ]+)` ` <a href="https://$2">$1</a>`

The goal of this release is to simplify and speed up Scroll by removing legacy features.
This is a major release that removes a bunch of the original parsers in favor of the newer more advanced aftertext nodes.
If you don't want to upgrade at this time, it's very easy to just add the removed grammar definitions from this commit into your existing scrolls using the normal extension pattern.
You can also easily alias the newer aftertext node types with the original parsers above if you'd prefer.

📦 36.1.0 10/27/2022

⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) removed "migrate" command. was more trouble than it was worth. better to have that as a separate module.
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) `where` command is now `list`

📦 32.0.0 9/27/2022
🎉 improved 'where' command to scan pwd and skip node_modules folders. much faster and simpler.

📦 31.5.0 9/9/2022
🎉 new parsers: `?`, `#` and `##`

# A Header

## A Subheader

? Have you thought of the most important question?

📦 31.4.1 9/3/2022
🏥 and that is why you always run the tests.

📦 31.4.0 9/3/2022
🎉 New parsers: `*`, `footnote`, and `readingList`

* This is a _thought_. It's like a condensed form of aftertext with *bold* and _italics_ and `code` turned on by default.
 hoverNote default
  And it supports hover notes!

📦 31.3.0 9/3/2022
🏥 Fixed bad regression where only the first atom of a replacement line was getting replaced.

📦 31.2.0 9/2/2022
🎉 added `openGraphImage` node

📦 31.1.0 9/1/2022
🎉 `replace` now supports multiline strings
🏥 fixed broken links bug if using keyboard nav without groups

📦 31.0.0 8/31/2022
⚠️ BREAKING: upgraded to jtree 56. This is not likely to break anyone. However, if you are extending Scroll with your own nodeTypes you will need to make sure that your abstract nodes (and *only* your abstract nodes) have an id that begins with `abstract`. You can then remove all occurrences of the parser `abstract` from your grammar node definitions.

📦 30.1.1 8/30/2022
🎉 Improve header message thanks to dg's feedback

📦 30.1.0 8/29/2022

📦 28.3.1 8/27/2022
🏥 fixed minor grammar typo and added test

📦 28.3.0 8/27/2022

📦 28.2.0 8/26/2022
🏥 export getFullyExpandedFile

📦 28.1.0 8/26/2022
🏥 imports can now be recursive

📦 28.0.0 8/26/2022
This is a *major* update that radically simplifies Scroll and adds significant new capabilities.

## From 3 file types to 1

`scroll.settings` and `*.grammar` files are gone. Everything is now done with `.scroll` files, and now every parser is documented and usable on try.scroll.com and type checked.

## Imports and variables

Use `[filepath]` to import one scroll file into another. Use `replace` and `replaceDefault` for variables.

## Add your own Grammar extensions directly in your Scroll files

Define new nodeTypes or create your own aliases on a per file basis. Use the import parser and build your own collection of common reusable node types for your project(s).

## Unlimited Tags and Tag Pages

Add files to one or more tags and then customize how each tag page prints. No more magic or implicit creation of collection pages.

## Multiple Compiler Passes

The new language features (imports, grammar nodes, and variables) required a change from a 1 one stage compilation process to a multi-stage compiler pass pattern. The compilers passes run in this order: imports, grammar extensions, then variables. So variables cannot be used in imports or grammar extensions.

## Change list

⚠️ BREAKING: The `git` setting is renamed to `viewSourceBaseUrl`
⚠️ BREAKING: The `sourceLink` setting is renamed to `viewSourceUrl`
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `skipIndexPage`. Instead you now opt-in to group pages like this: `groups index.html`
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `scroll.settings` concept. Use `settings.scroll` now.
⚠️ BREAKING: `footer` is now `scrollFooter` and `header` is now `scrollHeader`
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `ignoreGrammarFiles`. Custom grammar extensions must now be explicitly imported and/or be in `.scroll` files.
⚠️ BREAKING: changed link text from "Article source" to "View source"
⚠️ BREAKING: `css` setting is now `scrollCss`
⚠️ BREAKING: DefaultScrollScriptCompiler is now DefaultScrollCompiler
⚠️ BREAKING: removed buildSinglePages, buildIndexPage, buildSnippetsPage, buildRssFeed, and buildCssFile. Everything done by `buildFiles` now. See 'full.scroll', `index.scroll`, `feed.scroll`, and `style.scroll` in `tests/kitchenSink` for how to implement those in new pattern.
⚠️ BREAKING: in default theme CSS some class names have changed:

code
 scrollArticleDateComponent => scrollDateComponent
 scrollArticlePageComponent => scrollFilePageComponent
 scrollSingleArticleTitle => scrollFilePageTitle
 scrollIndexPageArticleContainerComponent => scrollGroupPageFileContainerComponent
 scrollArticleSourceLinkComponent => scrollFileViewSourceUrlComponent
 scrollIndexPageComponent => scrollGroupPageComponent
 scrollIndexPageFileContainerComponent => scrollGroupPageFileContainerComponent

⚠️ just calling ScrollScript Scroll again unless it becomes confusing
🎉 keyboardNav will now use the first group a file belongs to if prev and next are not supplied

⚠️ title2-title6 have been removed. use question, section and subsection instead.

? Why the new `question` nodes?

Question and answer structures are literally older than the Socratic Method. Such a common semantic pattern deserves it's own parsers.

? How do I migrate from title# nodes?

The below regex may help.

code
 Find ^title\d (.+\?)
  ReplaceWith question $1

🎉 skipIndexPage nodeType

? How do I use the new single atom links?

For single atom links in paragraph nodes only (for now) you can now do:

code
 paragraph
  This is a link🔗example.com

Below is a regex for migrating existing <code>*.scroll</code> files.

code
 <a href="https://([^"]+)">([^ ]+)</a>
 $2🔗$1

? How do I use the 🔗link tag with multiatom links?

The 🔗link tag only supports single atom links. Like everything with ScrollScript, you have a number of options if the conventional design doesn't work for you. Your options are:

- 1. Link just one atom. If you need more, perhaps camelCase or snake_case your atoms together into one concept.
- 2. Repeat the link twice <code>foo 🔗link bar 🔗link</code>
- 3. Use &lt;a> tags.
- 4. Extend the ScrollScript grammar for your site.

? Can I not include a page in the index page?
Now you can! Sometimes you just want to publish an independent page without including it in the index. To do that, just add `skipIndexPage`.

📦 12.1.0 05/14/2021

### Knowledge Bases
Scroll powers PLDB, a knowledge base with over 100 contributors who have added over 100,000 atoms of structured data and thousands of pages.
 https://pldb.io PLDB

### Static Sites
This site you are reading is powered by Scroll.
 index.html This site

? What makes Scroll different?
Scroll has an unusually simple syntax called Particles, an extensive set of parsers and commands needed by researchers, bloggers, knowledge bases and sites of all sizes, is highly expandable, and is familiar to anyone who knows Markdown.

? What is the Scroll command line app?
The command line app builds static blogs, websites, CSVs, text files, and more.
 blog/textFiles.html text files
 blog/scrollsets.html CSVs
 blog/index.html static blogs
 index.html websites

? How do I install the command line app?
Scroll currently requires Node.js.
 https://nodejs.org/ Node.js
After Node.js is installed, install the npm package with:
 https://www.npmjs.com/package/scroll-cli npm package
code
 npm install -g scroll-cli

? How do I install the developer version?
code
 git clone https://github.com/breck7/scroll.git
 cd scroll
 npm install -g .
 npm test

? How do I run the CLI?
code
 scroll help

? Is Scroll open source?
Yes. Breck's Lab publishes Scroll to the public domain.
 https://breckyunits.com/lab.html Breck's Lab

The source code is hosted on GitHub.
 https://github.com/breck7/scroll source code

? Is there an official blog for the project?
Yes.
 link blog/ Yes

? Who is Scroll for?
Scroll is built for bloggers who appreciate writing, minimal, well designed tools for thoughts, open source, git backed static site generators, and fast simple code.

? What makes Scroll different?
Scroll is different than other static site generators because it is also *an extendible language*.
 https://staticsitegenerators.net other static site generators

The basics of Scroll are even simpler than Markdown. For example, you can make a whole paragraph a link like this:

This is a link
 https://scroll.pub
aboveAsCode

You can stick to the basics or define new parsers to extend Scroll to better fit your content and workflows.

Your parsers can be simple or as complex as any programming language, and a simple indent is all you need to make sure your parser won't interfere with other parsers.

Parsers in Scroll are written in a mini language called ParsersLinks and both Scroll and Parsers are built on the syntax called ParticlesLinked.

? How does Scroll improve over the latest incarnations of Markdown?
Scroll evolved based on the theory that instead of a fixed language for blogging it is better to have an ever evolving ecosystem of parsers, so that your symbolic tools can grow along with your mental tools.

Thus, Scroll is designed to be easy to extend.

You can see this in the Scroll source code.

Scroll is a collection of ParsersLinks and there are currently dozens of `.parsers` files in the base distribution.

Each Parser can define a mini language of its own. You can simply add (or remove) Parsers to generate your own custom dialects to better fit your domains.

Think of it as one file, many languages.

Altering traditional languages in this fashion would lead to chaos, but Scroll does it in a stable and scalable way by making the most of the indent trick (also known as the off-side rule). Each line gets its own scope. So you can add, remove, and update your microlanguages and their associated blocks without breaking the rest of the documents.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule off-side rule

In Scroll, it's almost as if each line is its own file.

? How do I extend Scroll?
Imagine you run a cooking blog where you share recipes. It may be useful to present recipes to your readers in a specialized style. You could create a _recipe_ parser and write a post like this:
code
 # McCarthy Salad
  https://www.dorchestercollection.com/the-edit/los-angeles/our-famous-mccarthy-salad-recipe
 
 recipe
  ingredients For salad
   ¼ head iceberg lettuce
   ½ head romaine lettuce
   ½ cup diced, grilled free-range chicken
   ½ cup diced, roasted red beets
   ¼ cup free-range egg yolk
   ¼ cup free-range egg white
   ½ cup finely diced aged cheddar cheese
   ½ cup applewood-smoked bacon
   ¼ cup diced tomato
   ¼ cup diced avocado
  step Dice ingredients.
  step Artfully arrange the salad ingredients in a bowl.
  ingredients For salad dressing
   1 cup balsamic vinegar
   1 shallot
   3 cloves roasted garlic
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
   Salt and black pepper to season
   Canola oil
  step Place the dressing ingredients in a blender and drizzle in the canola oil to emulsify.
  step Combine and mix salad and dressing!
  step Enjoy!
Notice that your post uses the first atom `recipe`, but Scroll does not have a parser for that. No problem, just write a recipe parser yourself using ParsersLinks, extending your dialect of Scroll:
code
 recipeParser
  extends abstractScrollParser
  cue recipe
  javascript
   buildHtml() {
     const addYourSpecialMagic = ""
     return `<div>${addYourSpecialMagic}</div>`
   }
Your extension might generate beautiful custom HTML for that recipe section and also perhaps allow users to vote on it, or include it in a CSV export, et cetera. Scroll let's you combine microlanguages in a simple and non-conflicting way. What you do with those languages is up to you.
For an extended example of extending Scroll check out this one which adds node types for Markdown, Textile, and BBCode.
 https://scroll.pub/blog/indented-heredocs.html one

? What is the biggest downside to Scroll?
Compared to Markdown there is very little tooling and the ecosystem is currently very small.
Also, although it is simple to write your own parsers in ParsersLinks once you know what you're doing, documentation for ParsersLinks is still poor and tooling isn't great yet.

? What kind of sites can I use Scroll to build?
Scroll is a great solution for blogs and sites of one page, a few pages, tens of pages, hundreds of pages, or even thousands of pages.
 https://scroll.pub one page
 https://scroll.pub/blog/ a few pages
 https://breckyunits.com/code/ tens of pages
 https://breckyunits.com/ hundreds of pages
 https://pldb.io/ thousands of pages

? How do I get Scroll?
Scroll is a language and command line app you install on your local machine. Scroll requires basic familiarity with the command line and NodeJs >=18. If you do not have NodeJs, Mac/Linux users can install NodeJs with #n# (make sure to install with `--arch arm64` flag for M1s+) and Windows users can install NodeJs with Scoop.
 https://nodejs.org NodeJs
 inlineMarkup # https://github.com/tj/n
 https://scoop.sh/ Scoop
If you would like to use Scroll but aren't familiar with the command line, please open an issue and we may be able to help.
Once you have NodeJs installed you can install from GitHub or npm. Scroll is scroll-cli on npm.
 https://www.npmjs.com/package/scroll-cli scroll-cli
You can install from GitHub:
code
 git clone https://github.com/breck7/scroll
 cd scroll
 npm install -g .
Or you can install Scroll with npm by typing:
code
 npm install -g scroll-cli --production

One way to try the Scroll command line app without installing is with GitPod.
 https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/breck7/scroll GitPod

? How do I use Scroll?
Scroll is a command line app. To see the commands type:
code

? What are some example sites using Scroll?
Scroll currently powers blog and sites of one page, a few pages, tens of pages, hundreds of pages, and even thousands of pages.
 https://scroll.pub one page
 https://scroll.pub/blog/ a few pages
 https://breckyunits.com/code/ tens of pages
 https://breckyunits.com/ hundreds of pages
 https://pldb.io/ thousands of pages

? What does a typical project folder look like?
A typical Scroll project folder, excluding the files built by Scroll, looks like this:
code
 📁yourDomainName.org
  about.scroll
  helloWorld.scroll
  index.scroll
  header.scroll
  footer.scroll
  anImageInTheArticle.png
When you run `scroll build`, Scroll reads those files and generates the outputs right in that site's folder.
With Scroll your site's Scroll files and static files and generated html are all in one public folder and checked into version control. Usually you want to add `*.html` and `feed.xml` to your `.gitignore`.

? How do I save drafts?
Have a drafts folder next to your published scroll. For example:
code
 📁drafts
  someDraft.scroll
 📁yourDomainName.org
  publishedArticle.scroll

? What file formats does Scroll use?
Scroll articles are written as Scroll files with the file extension scroll. The current base parsers for Scroll are defined here.
 code scroll
 https://github.com/breck7/scroll/tree/main/parsers here

? What language is Scroll written in?
Scroll is written in Particles, ParsersLinks, and Javascript. The Scroll CLI app is written in plain Javascript and runs in Node.js. Scroll also uses a few other microlangs written in Parsers.

TypeScript is not used in the Scroll repo and because the Javascript is only ~1kloc that likely will not be necessary.

? How does versioning of articles work?
Scroll is designed for git. A single article is stored as a single file tracked by git.

? When I run `scroll format` in what order are particles sorted?
The rough order is:
code
 [importOnly?]
 [topMatter*]
 [measurements*]
 [everythingElse*]

? Is Scroll public domain?
Yes! Scroll is also 100% focused on helping people build internal or *public domain sites* and everything is designed with that assumption.

? Why does the default theme have a single page layout?
The default Scroll theme is designed to make it easier for syntopic reading. Being able to scan the page like a newspaper. This allows you to read at a higher level—to "get in the author's head"—compared to reading one article at a time from beginning to end.
 https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book syntopic reading
And if anyone prefers to read a scroll in a different way—they can! Scroll is for public domain sites. People are free to arrange the symbols any way they wish.

? Will you make design decisions for non-public domain sites?
No.

? Can I use Scroll for internal private sites not intended for publishing?
Yes!

? In the single page layout why don't you have only the newest articles above the fold?
This was originally a bug. But then it turns out to be a feature, as it gives older articles, which are often more important, more visibility.

? How do I recursively build multiple scrolls in child folders?
code
 scroll list | scroll build

? What's an easy way to have GitHub run Scroll and build my HTML files automatically?
Go to your project folder and create the file below:
code
 mkdir -p .github/workflows
 touch .github/workflows/wws.yaml
Then open that file and paste in this code:
code
 # Adapted from https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action
 name: Build and Deploy Scroll
 on:
   push:
     branches:
       - main
 jobs:
   build-and-deploy:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - name: Checkout 🛎️
         uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.1
       - name: Install and Build
         run: |
           npm install -g scroll-cli --production
           scroll build
           # The line below is needed if you have *.html in your gitignore file
           rm .gitignore
       - name: Deploy 🚀
         uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4
         with:
           branch: wws # The branch the action should deploy to.
           folder: .
Commit and push. Now go to your GitHub Repo and then Settings, then Pages, and select the wws branch as the Source for the pages. Click save. Your built site should be live.
 code Settings
 code Pages
 code wws

? How do I setup a custom 404 page with GitHub pages?
Check out the `404.scroll` file in this folder.

GitHub has instructions but is really is as simple as this:
 https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site instructions

? How do I check for broken links?
Scroll does not check for broken links. For that, try linkinator.
 https://github.com/JustinBeckwith/linkinator linkinator
code
 # npm install -g linkinator
 linkinator https://scroll.pub > brokenLinks.txt

? How do I check browser performance?
Scroll does not have browser perf tools built in. For that, try lighthouse.
 https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse lighthouse
code
 # npm install -g lighthouse
 lighthouse https://scroll.pub --output-path scrollBrowserPerf.html; open scrollBrowserPerf.html

? Where should I host my site?
Any web server works. You can even host your scroll for free using GitHub Pages, just like this site.
 https://pages.github.com GitHub Pages

? How do I use Scroll with a custom domain?
Just buy a domain and point it to your web server or web host (such as GitHub Pages). Google Domains is where this domain is registered and is a great service.
 https://domains.google Google Domains

? How can I deploy my site?
If you have your own web server try rsync. Here's a bash one liner:
code
 # deploy.sh
 # swap "/var/www/html" with the path to your website's location on your web server
 rsync -vr /[path/to/your/site]/* [yourdomain.com]:/var/www/html
Add a section like the one below to your ~.ssh/config to save your username and correct key pair.
 https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/494483/specifying-an-identityfile-with-ssh section
code
 Host example.com
   User yourUserName
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/example_id_rsa
   IdentitiesOnly yes

? Does Scroll compile to plain text as well as HTML?
Yes! Support for plain text outputs as added in April, 2024.
 https://scroll.pub/blog/textFiles.html

? How can I output my Scroll to an EPUB file?
Pandoc is one way to do it. If you are on a Mac and have Homebrew installed:
 https://brew.sh Homebrew
code
 brew install pandoc
 pandoc index.html -o book.epub

? How can I do hot reloading?
Scroll does not come with hot reloading but you can easily set it up with `nodemon`. Install `nodemon` with `sudo npm install -g nodemon`. Then run:
bashCode
 nodemon -e scroll -x "scroll build"
Or alias it:
bashCode
 alias watch="nodemon -e scroll -x 'scroll build'"
You can also add the following code to the page(s) you are working on to have them reload without manually refreshing the browser:
scrollCode
 html <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1;">

? How can I track web traffic?
Scroll emits HTML with zero Javascript and does not have any tracking or cookies. You can easily add your own tracking tag if you want.

If you are self hosting using a web server like Nginx you might have some access logs on your server. The one liner below uses GoAccess to summarize recent Nginx access logs.
 https://goaccess.io GoAccess
code
 # apt-get install goaccess
 goaccess /var/log/nginx/access.log -o /var/www/html/YOUR_SECRET_REPORT_URL.html --log-format=COMBINED --real-time-html --ws-url=wss://YOURDOMAIN.com

? Does Scroll support RSS?
Yes! Just create a `feed.scroll` file like this.
 https://github.com/breck7/scroll/blob/main/blog/feed.scroll this

? Does Scroll support tags?
Yes! Add tags to a post using the `tags` parser. Then create a `yourTagName.scroll` file to create a category page for that tag. See a demo here.
 https://github.com/breck7/scroll/blob/main/blog/index.scroll here

? Does Scroll support Open Graph tags for better social media sharing?
Yes. By default the first image and first paragraph of an article will be used for the "og:" tags. Unfortunately Twitter doesn't support relative image links so you need to specify `baseUrl`. For more help check out the debuggers from Facebook and X or try LinkPreview.
 https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug Facebook
 https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator X
 https://linkpreview.xyz/ LinkPreview

? Does Scroll support themes and templates?
Yes! Scroll includes a simple API for changing the style of your site. This is an active area of development so please reach out if you'd like to customize the look of your Scroll.

? How can I build a scroll from a Twitter account?
Hopefully someone will build a package or site that does this. For now, on your Twitter settings, download an archive of your data and convert the tweets JSON into scroll files. Or to experiment faster use this tool to grab some tweets as a TSV.
 https://www.vicinitas.io/free-tools/download-user-tweets tool

? What were some alternatives considered?
There was no publishing software that reads and writes Scroll yet so building Scroll was necessary. Jekyll and Brecksblog were the two biggest inspirations.

 https://github.com/breck7/brecksblog Brecksblog

# Contributing to Scroll development
? How do I contribute?
File issues. Share your Scroll sites.
You can submit pull requests too. The shorter the better.

? How do I debug node.js performance?
code
 # cd your_slow_scroll
 # you may need to update the path below so it points to your scroll code
 node --cpu-prof --cpu-prof-name=scrollNodePerf.cpuprofile ~/scroll/scroll.js build
 # Now ➡️ open a new Chrome tab ➡️ open devtools ➡️ click Performance ➡️ click "Load Profile..." ➡️ select your scrollNodePerf.cpuprofile
 # For profiling memory, use this line:
 node --cpu-prof --cpu-prof-name=scrollNodePerf.cpuprofile --heap-prof --heap-prof-name=scrollNodeMem.heapprofile ~/scroll/scroll.js build
 # Now ➡️ open a new Chrome tab ➡️ open devtools ➡️ click Memory ➡️ click "Load Profile..." ➡️ select your scrollNodeMem.heapprofile

? How is a parser different than a web component?
Scroll Parsers and Web Components are similar in that both empower users to define their own reusable components. But Scroll is higher level than web components. For example, in addition to easily targeting HTML and web components, Scroll also plays really nicely with version control and 2D editors. Scroll encourages encoding semantic content with as little noise as possible, which creates benefits in many places.

? How do I run cross browser tests?
For that we use BrowserStack.
 https://browserstack.com BrowserStack

? Is there a subreddit to discuss Scroll?
Yes.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldWideScroll/

? How many compiler passes are there in the language?
Each Scroll file is currently passed over 4 times during compilation to HTML and/or text.
1. The full file is read.
2. All `import` statements are replaced with the contents of the imported file.
3. All variable `replace` statements are executed and applied to the current file.
4. Finally, an extended Scroll parser is constructed if needed (if any new parser definitions appear in the document), and then is used to parse the resulting file for compilation.

? Is there a chart showing all the layers of Scroll?

? Why the name Scroll?
The scroll was invented thousands of years ago and scrolls are still useful today. Scroll has been designed with a focus on simplicity and a goal of making something that would have been useful decades ago, with the hope that this will make it useful decades into the future.

? What is Scroll?

Scroll is a new computer language that evolved from taking one question very seriously: what if you removed every unnecessary stroke from a language? What if you made a language as simple as possible?

Scroll is the result of relentlessly pursuing those questions.

This tutorial will walk you through the basics of using Scroll.

---

## A Scroll document
A Scroll document (or "program") is a _list of lines_.

Each line can contain content (or "atoms").

For example, here is a line containing 3 atoms:

code
 title Hello world

In addition to containing atoms, each line can have its own document with its own lines using indentation.

When you add a space at the beginning of a line, that line becomes a "subparticle" of the parent line.

code
 image hello.png
  caption This line is a subparticle of the line above.

You may have seen this _indent trick_ before in languages like Python.

But Scroll pushes it to the max.

Master the indent trick and master Scroll.

But we're getting ahead of ourselves, let's start with the basics.

---

# Parsers

Every line in a Scroll document matches and is parsed by a Parser.

You can see all the available parsers in the Scroll Leet Sheet.
 leetsheet.html Scroll Leet Sheet

(Advanced users who want to write their own parsers might want to checkout the Parsers Leet Sheet.)
 parserLeetsheet.html Parsers Leet Sheet

Let's walk through some of the most common parsers.

---

# Basic Lines
## 1. The Paragraph Parser

Let's start with the most common parser, the `paragraph` parser.

You can think of paragraphs as similar to a `p` or `div` tag in HTML.

To use this parser you can write out the atom `paragraph`, or use an asterisk `*`, OR just start any text that does not match another parser (the "catch all" parser of a Scroll program is the paragraph parser).

This paragraph was compiled by the catch all paragraph parser. The code is:
aboveAsCode

## 2. Headers
Scroll has headers like markdown:
belowAsCode 2
# This is a section header
## This is a subsection header

## 3. Unordered lists
Here's how you write unordered lists:
belowAsCode 2
- Scroll has lists
 - That can be nested

## 4. Checklists
Below is the code for a checklist and its rendered version:
belowAsCode 2
[] Finish full tutorial
 [x] Learn that checklists support nesting

## 5. Tables
Use the `datatable` parser to make tables:
belowAsCode
datatable
 printTable
 data
  Name,Rank
  Scroll,#1
  Markdown,#2

## 6. Images
To add an image use the `image` parser:
belowAsCode 2
https://scroll.pub/blog/screenshot.png
 caption An image with a caption

## 7. Footnotes
You can make footnotes like this:
belowAsCode 2
Pau means done^pau
^pau In Hawaiian

## 8. Dashboard
If you are building a dashboard you might want to try the `dashboard` parser:
belowAsCode
dashboard
 #1 Lang
 2k Users
 300 Stars

## 9. Including HTML and CSS
html If you need to jump into regular HTML, use the `html` parser.
aboveAsCode

For CSS, use the `css` parser:
belowAsCode 2
css .green {color: green;}
This text should be green.
 addClass green

---

# Marking Up Text
## Inline markups
You can use inline markups similar to Markdown or Textile.
belowAsCode
Here's how to *bold*, _italicize_, or denote `code`.

## HTML markups
You can use also markup text using HTML.
belowAsCode
Here's how to <b>bold</b>.

## Aftertext
Scroll invented something called aftertext, where you put markup after the text.
 https://breckyunits.com/aftertext.html

For example, instead of mixing in the link with the content, you put the link _after the text_ along with the text you want the link to match against. For example:
belowAsCode
A link to Wikipedia
 https://wikipedia.org Wikipedia
You can also make the whole paragraph a link by not including any text to match against.
belowAsCode
A link to Wikipedia
 https://wikipedia.org

## Columns
You can use the `thinColumns [maxNumberOfColumns]` parser to start a columns flow and `endColumns` to end a columns flow. If you don't want a section to break across columns, don't put line breaks in between lines. Line breaks will clear sections.

---

# Advanced
## Variables
Use the `replace` parser to define macros. Macros definitions are parsed and removed on the first compiler pass.
Our domain is: *DOMAIN*

## Import statements
Scroll files can import other Scroll files. Use the `import` parser by just specifyingcthe path to the file, such as: `header.scroll`

---

## Themes
Scroll ships with some default themes, which are just CSS files.

## Examples
## A page using no theme:
code
 # This page has no theme
## A page using a theme:
code
 theme gazette
 homeButton
 editButton
 This page uses the Gazette theme.

---

# Expert: Adding your own parsers
_Note: Custom Parsers are currently only supported using the `npm` package. The web editor does *not* currently support custom parsers_.

You can define your own parsers right in your Scroll documents using `*Parser`.

Here is a simple example that extends Scroll by making `p` work the same as `*`:

belowAsCode 2
pParser
 extends scrollParagraphParser
 cue p
p We can then make paragraphs using `p`.

Let's now make a `hiddenMessage` Parser that alerts a message when clicked:
belowAsCode 3
messageParser
 cueFromId
 catchAllAtomType stringAtom
hiddenMessageParser
 extends scrollParagraphParser
 inScope messageParser
 cueFromId
 javascript
  buildHtml() {
   return `<span onclick="alert('${this.get("message")}')">${super.buildHtml()}</span>`
  }
hiddenMessage Click me.
 message Hello world

As you can see, you can define new parsers with a small amount of code.

You probably also can see that the Parsers code is powerful but has lots of sharp edges.

While the documentation on Parsers evolves, feel free to get in touch for help in adding your own parsers.
