# Scroll is an extensible alternative to Markdown.
Like Markdown, Scroll is a plaintext language that compiles to HTML.
# Scroll is minimal and extensible—designed to help you *clarify* and *fully develop* your thoughts.

Scroll is improving fast. Scroll debuted in 2021 and is now on Version 59.

# This Tutorial will walk you through most keywords in Scroll AND teach you how to build your own Scroll keywords.

## A Scroll document
A Scroll document (or "program") is a _list of nodes_. Every node is one line and every line is one node.
If you put a space at the beginning of a line, that line becomes a child of the preceding line. You have probably seen this _indent trick_ before in languages like Python. But Scroll pushes it to the max.
If you master the indent trick, you master Scroll. But we're getting ahead of ourselves, let's start with the basics.

# Basic Node Types
## 1. The Thought Node (aka "Paragraph" node)
Let's start with the most common node, the `thought` node. You can think of this node as similar to a `p` or `div` tag in HTML. To use this node you can write out the word `thought`, or use an asterisk `*`, OR just start any text that does not begin with a keyword.  This paragraph you are reading is written using one of these nodes. The code is:
aboveAsCode

## 2. Headers
There are a few types of headers in scroll. Let's show the 3 main ones and what they generate:
belowAsCode 3
title This is a title
# This is a section header
## This is a subsection header

## 3. Unordered lists
Here's how you write unordered lists:
belowAsCode 2
- Scroll has lists
 - That can be nested

## 4. Checklists
Below is the code for a checklist and its rendered version:

 [x] Learn that checklists support nesting

## 5. Tables
Use the `table` keyword and include your delimiter for tables:
belowAsCode
table ,
 Name,Rank
 Scroll,#1
 Markdown,#2

## 6. Images
To add an image use the `image` keyword:
belowAsCode 2
image https://scroll.pub/blog/screenshot.png
 caption An image with a caption

## 7. Footnotes
You can make footnotes like this:
belowAsCode 2
Pau means done^pau
^pau In Hawaiian

## 8. Dashboard
If you are building a dashboard you might want to try the `dashboard` keyword:
dashboard
 #1 Lang
 2k Users
 300 Stars

## 9. Including HTML and CSS
html If you need to jump into regular HTML, use the <code>html</code> keyword.
aboveAsCode

For CSS, use the `css` keyword:
belowAsCode 2
css .green {color: green;}
This text should be green.
 class green

# Marking Up Text
## Bold, italics and code
Formatting text is similar to Markdown or Textile.
belowAsCode
Here's how to *bold*, _italicize_, or denote `code`.

## Links
Scroll does links different. Instead of mixing in the link with the content, you put the link _after the text_ along with the text you want the link to match against. For example:
belowAsCode
A link to Wikipedia
 https://wikipedia.org Wikipedia
You can also make the whole paragraph a link by not including any text to match against.
belowAsCode
A link to Wikipedia
 https://wikipedia.org

## Columns
You can use the `startColumns [maxNumberOfColumns]` keyword to start a columns flow and `endColumns` to end a columns flow. If you don't want a section to break across columns, don't put line breaks in between lines. Line breaks will clear sections.

# Advanced
## Variables
Use the `replace` keyword to define variables. Variables definitions are parsed and removed on the first compiler pass.
replace DOMAIN scroll.pub
Our domain is: *DOMAIN*

## Import statements
Scroll files can import other Scroll files. Use the `import` keyword followed by the path to the file, such as: `import header.scroll`

---

# Advanced: Custom Themes
A standard Scroll Theme consists of CSS and may also contain suggested pages and additional Grammar extensions. The default scroll theme is called `Gazette`. The checklist below walks you through creating a complete Scroll Theme like Gazette.

[] Create a `[yourThemeName].grammar` file
[] Add a `[yourThemeName]CssParser`
 - You can refer to the `gazetteCssParser` in `gazetteTheme.grammar` for an example. Your theme can extend `abstractThemeCssParser` or be its own tag.
 [] Add CSS. The Gazette theme uses Hakon, a language that compiles to CSS, but you are free to use plain CSS—even in an external file.
  [] Add CSS resets. Like any other normal site you probably want to adjust the base CSS of the browser.
  [] Add any custom styles for any custom keywords you include in your theme. If you don't have any custom keywords you can skip this step.
  [] Add CSS for the standard Scroll keywords. You probably want to customize the styles of Scroll keywords like `*` and `#`. There is not currently an exhaustive list or consistent pattern to these class names. See the Gazette theme for reference.

## Using Custom Themes
By default Scroll emits HTML with no theming. To use any theme—including the default `Gazette` theme—the user simply uses the keywords provided by the theme, such as `gazetteCss`.

## Examples
## A page using no theme:
code
 # This page has no theme
## A page using a theme:
code
 gazetteCss
 pageHeader
 * This page uses the Gazette theme.
 pageFooter

# Expert: Adding your own parsers
Scroll is based on the theory that a language should adapt to the domain, not the other way around. So Scroll has extendibility built-in.

_Note: Custom Parsers are currently only supported using the `npm` package. The web editor does *not* currently support custom keywords_.

You can define your own parsers right in your Scroll documents using `*Parser`. These Parsers are written in the `Grammar` language.

Here is a simple example that extends Scroll by making `p` work the same as `*`:

belowAsCode 2
pParser
 extends thoughtParser
 crux p
p We can then make paragraphs using `p`.

Let's now make a `hiddenMessage` Parser that alerts a message when clicked:
belowAsCode 3
messageParser
 cruxFromId
 catchAllCellType stringCell
hiddenMessageParser
 extends thoughtParser
 inScope messageParser
 cruxFromId
 javascript
  compile() {
    return `<span onclick="alert('${this.get('message')}')">${super.compile()}</span>`
  }
hiddenMessage Click me.
 message Hello world

As you can see, you can define new parsers with a small amount of code. You probably also can see that the Grammar Langauge is powerful but has lots of sharp edges. While the documentation on Grammar evolves, feel free to get in touch for help in adding your own parsers.
