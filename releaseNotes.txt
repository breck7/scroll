permalink style.css
gazetteCss
 tags false
Do this:

100.0.0 7/02/2024
=================
🎉 if not present, `date` is now derived from file creation time
🎉 if not present, `title` is now computed by un-camelcasing the filename
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) date and title are now computed automatically so if you had a file missing those previously on purpose (for some reason), they will now actually have those.

================
🏥 katex should print contents in txt compilation

93.7.0 5/29/2024

🏥 fixed bug where updates to externals would not get copied

93.0.0 5/21/2024
================
🎉 `scroll format` command now also prettifies concepts and measurements in ScrollSets. If a measurement's `sortIndex` jumps to a new integer (for example, 1.9 to 2.1), a newline will be inserted before it.
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) the default `sortIndex` is now 1.9, and the sort index of `id` is 1.0. Update `sortIndex` accordingly.

92.0.0 5/20/2024
================
🎉 simplified ScrollSets by removing the filename "magic". When putting a concept into a file, make the `id` the filename (without the extension). Have the id be a simple one word url friendly string. If you want a pretty title, add a `name` measure. Everything much simpler this way.
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) remove any spaghetti filename code.

91.0.0 5/19/2024
================
🎉 `printAuthor` parser prints the author defined by `author`. `byLine` has been deprecated--replace with `printAuthor`.

90.2.1 5/18/2024
================
🏥 fixed `metaTags` from breaking try.scroll.pub
🏥 got `slideshow` working on try.scroll.pub

90.2.0 5/18/2024

90.1.0 5/17/2024
================
🎉 2.5x faster test running thanks to adding cacheing to measure parser

90.0.0 5/16/2024
================
⚠️ BREAKING: `idParser` and `filenameParser` no longer ship in default grammar. This will allow for useful future dataset features. Instead, add them yourself if you are using Concepts like this:

idParser

filenameParser
 extends abstractFilenameParser

89.2.1 5/16/2024
================
🏥 fixed required measurements when computeds are involved
🎉 print folder name when running scroll test

================
🏥 minor fix in themes grammar.

89.1.0 5/15/2024
================
🎉 added ability to override content in `printTitle`

89.0.0 5/15/2024
================
🎉 `printTitle` parser added for easier templates
⚠️ BREAKING: `title` is now a setter. This regex handles the migration:
 - `^title ` `printTitle\ntitle `
  - Then (optionally) run "scroll format" or "scroll list | scroll format" to format which will automove your titles up top.

88.0.0 5/15/2024
================
🎉 easier snippets! if you have a dinkus anywhere "***|****|---", that will be used as an "endSnippet"
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected). If you had a post that purposefully had no `endSnippet` and does have a dinkus, it will now generate a snippet rather than using the whole post.

87.0.1 5/15/2024
================
🏥 fixed off by 1 bug in computed measures

87.0.0 5/14/2024
================

🏥 add relative paths to sitemaps if needed

86.0.1 5/12/2024
================
🏥 improved test coverage

86.0.0 5/12/2024
================
🎉 added a v1 version of a markdown style of doing quotes `>` (with aftertext support)!
🎨 made the View Source links have same style as other Scroll chrome, and removed those links in short snippet renders (never get needed there--only on the actual page)
⚠️ BREAKING: if you have any lines starting with `> `, those will now be parsed by the quickQuoteParser

85.9.0 5/12/2024
================
🎉 added `minutes` to read (assuming 200 words/minute) to `printSearch` and `printCsv` exports
🎉 you can now pass groups to `sitemap` for making sitemaps specific to certain folders/groups
🎉 for `printFeed`, `snippets`, `fullSnippets` providing groups is now optional

85.8.0 5/10/2024
================
🎉 measures and concepts can now also be written as Javascript for explore pages.

85.7.0 5/10/2024
================

85.6.0 5/10/2024
================
🎉 `sortBy` can now sort on multiple columns and handle asc/desc

85.5.0 5/10/2024
================
🎉 `writeConcepts` and `writeMeasures` can now take multiple filenames in one line and also include a `sortBy` condition.

85.4.0 5/10/2024
================
🎉 Scroll now auto-adds a "filename" measure as to which file the concept appears in.

85.3.0 5/10/2024
================
🎉 Scroll now only wraps compiler output with html tags if permalink ends in "html" or "htm". Makes it easier to use Scroll to compile files to different language targets.

85.2.1 5/10/2024
================
🏥 fixed bug where `id` measure was appearing twice

85.2.0 5/10/2024
================
🏥 fixed bug with nested measure names.
🎉 some slight enhancements to computed measures

85.1.0 5/09/2024
================
🎉 added support for nested measures. The underscore "_" character is used for column names for nested measures for the broadest compatibility with other data science tools

85.0.0 5/08/2024
================
🎉 upgraded jtree to get ability for faster compilations
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `replaceDefault` parser. No one should be affected.
⚠️ BREAKING: renamed `nodejs` parser to `replaceNodejs. Few should be affected.

=================
🏥 fix hanging test (infinite loop regression) during build when you have just 1 file.

84.10.0 5/08/2024
=================
🎉 faster html generation when `keyboardNav` was in use. First implementation was accidentally quadratic.

84.9.0 5/08/2024
================
🎉 faster concepts and measures compilation

84.8.1 5/07/2024
================
🏥 `printSearchTable` now generates correct links when searching across multiple folders

84.8.0 5/07/2024
================
🎉 `tableSearch` now takes a parameter from the url `#q=[search]`. Updating the searching box also updates url.

84.7.0 5/07/2024
================
🎉 Added `printSearchTable` parser

84.6.0 5/07/2024
================
🎉 Added support for computed measures
🎉 better measure statistics printing

84.5.1 5/07/2024
================
🏥 better error printing with `scroll test` and fix bug in `percentCell`

84.5.0 5/07/2024
================
🎉 Added `writeMeasures` and `printMeasures` parsers
🎉 Added `abstractPercentageMeasureParser`

84.4.0 5/06/2024
================
🎉 Added `loadConcepts` parser for if you had a dataset split into many files in a folder.
🎉 Added `float sortIndex [int]` for sorting the measures(columns) in dataset generation. Lower sort indexes come first.

84.3.0 5/06/2024
================
🎉 `scroll test` will now report if an aftertext pattern has no matches.

84.2.0 5/06/2024
================
🎉 added `****` as an "end of post dinkus" which prints ⁂
🎉 tabular tables now support aftertext!
🏥 allow multiword strings to be used as an `id` in concepts

84.1.0 5/04/2024
================
🎉 snippets now export some content in plain text
🎉 improved the default site generated by `scroll init`

84.0.0 5/04/2024
================
🎉 Datasets (aka "Concept files") version 2! Much simpler.
🎉 Added the `id` parser for using datasets.
🎉 Removed the `[measureName]: ` syntax introduced in version 77. You no longer have to worry about the annoyance that introduced when writing a paragraph such as "Sidenote: yada yada".
🎉 Added `belowAsCodeUntil` parser

⚠️ BREAKING: removed `::` parser. Now concepts are simply identified by the parser `id`.
⚠️ BREAKING: `writeDataset` is now `writeConcepts` and `printDataset` is now `printConcepts`.
⚠️ BREAKING: Removed the `[measureName]: ` syntax introduced in version 77. To use datasets (aka Concept files) now, just extend Scroll parsers like you normally would. See this blog post for an example.
 https://scroll.pub/blog/datasets.html

83.3.0 5/04/2024
================
🎉 repeating the baseUrl after `openGraphImage` is no longer required. Will be auto-added if not present.

83.2.0 5/04/2024
================
🎉 added `link` under `image`. Also added `target`.
🎉 for posts with multiple images, you can now put `openGraph` under an `image` node as an alternative to adding a separate `openGraphImage` line
🎉 added `mediumColumns` parser
🎉 added `thinColumns` parser.

Note: `startColumns` will eventually be removed. You can now safely switch those to `thinColumns`.

83.1.0 5/03/2024
================
🎉 added `expander` parser

Click me
Anything in the section will show up here. A blank line ends a section.

83.0.0 5/03/2024
================
🎉 all tables now print in plain text outputs
🎉 added `printTable` parser
⚠️ BREAKING: root level tabular tables no longer produce output. Add a `printTable [index]` to print any existing tabular tables.

`printTable` will look for a table to print using this strategy:
- If an index is provided, print that table.
- Else, is there a table right below this line?
- Else, is there a table right before this line?
- Else, print the first table in the file.

82.2.0 5/03/2024
================
🎉 pruned more files from `npm install`

82.1.0 5/03/2024
================
🎉 pruned dependencies to make `npm install -g scroll-cli --production` fast

82.0.1 5/01/2024
================
🏥 fixed regression where `endSnippet` was showing up in html

82.0.0 5/01/2024
================
🎉 meta tags can now have nested comments
🎉 added `formatCommand` to the CLI for nicely formatting files, moving top matter to the top, cleaning up white space, etc, so you don't have to worry about that.
🎉 plain text files now will have a maximum of 2 blank lines in a row
🎉 plain text files now print date, if there's a dateline

The current formatting conventions are:

- Scroll files end in a single newline
- Trailing spaces and tabs are stripped from lines, unless the whole line is whitespace
- `importOnly`, if present, is moved to the very top
- 3 or more newlines are trimmed down to 2
- Meta tags are moved to the top of the file
- 2 newlines comes after meta tags
- Tags that print content and comments stay put
- Meta tags are sorted alphabetically with no blank lines in between [In the future, may want to allow customizing this]

Note that currently the `title` tag is a meta tag and a tag that prints content. Going to split that up into 2 tags soon.
Note that if you are doing something like a tutorial and using a `belowAsCode` where you purposely put a top matter parser not at the top, it will currently get moved to the top by format. We can probably add a feature like treating meta nodes with `// noFormat` as if they were content nodes.

81.2.0 4/30/2024
================
🎉 added `related` and `relatedList` parsers

81.1.0 4/29/2024
================
🎉 added `plainTextOnly` for rare case when you need to include content only for the plain text version.
🏥 `html` should not print in text versions (since it is _html_ :)).

81.0.0 4/29/2024
================
🏥 links now appear in plain text output. relative links are made absolute.
🏥 indented lists now appear in plain text output.

⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) if you extended the `thoughtParser`, that is now called `paragraphParser`.

80.2.1 4/29/2024
================
🏥 fixed regression in tabular tables printing

80.2.0 4/29/2024
================
🎉 added `helpfulNotFound` parser for better 404s.

80.1.0 4/29/2024
================
🎉 `wordCount` in `printCsv` now measures wordCount in the text version of a post.

80.0.0 4/29/2024
================
🎉 Scroll now generates text files! Added the `writeText` parser.
 https://scroll.pub/blog/textFiles.html

Note: there are likely to be a few rapid releases to refine this.

79.1.0 4/27/2024
================
🎉 added `printSiteMap` parser for text sitemap generation.

79.0.1 4/27/2024
================
🏥 fix npm issue

79.0.0 4/27/2024
================
🎉 better offline builds: if used, katex, tableSearch, and maps now copy their needed css and js into their folder and those assets are served locally rather than through CDN.
⚠️ BREAKING: you may need to make some slight updates, such as adding the copied files to .gitignore.

78.0.2 4/27/2024
================
🏥 open graph image url fix: remove the extra "/" which caused images not to show in Twitter

78.0.1 4/26/2024
================
🏥 style fix: ensure column splits don't separate images from their captions

78.0.0 4/25/2024
================
🎉 made tabular data a root level parser in Scroll.
⚠️ BREAKING: if you had lines with tabs that currently match the catchall paragraph, you'll need to make those explicit paragraphs to avoid them getting parsed by the tabular data parser. You should be able to find those lines with a regex like this: `^(\t|[^ ]+\t)`

Spreadsheets are great tools for working with tabular data. I want to copy/paste between Scroll docs and spreadsheets. This makes it easier.

Tabular data is better than line orientation for experimental data because it requires half the number of tokens and it's more efficient eye movement during comparisons and proofreading.

Scroll already supported tabular data using `tabTable`, but that made copy/paste workflows between spreadsheets and text editors a pain. This should be more ergonomic and make it easier to work with this useful tool of thought.

77.3.1 4/23/2024
================
🏥 style fix: fixed style bug where on narrow screens the post title would overlap the corner nav buttons.

77.3.0 4/22/2024
================
🎨 updated presentation of footnotes

77.2.0 4/22/2024
================
🎨 improved default table styles

77.1.0 4/21/2024
================
🎉 Simplified datasets further after user tests.

77.0.0 4/21/2024
================
🎉 Added Scroll Datasets, which consists of the `::`, `printDataset`, `writeDataset`, and `*:` and `*::` parsers.
 https://scroll.pub/blog/datasets.html

⚠️ BREAKING: if you had lines starting with a word then colon, that used the catchall paragraph, such as `Sidenote: yada yada.`, those will now be parsed incorrectly as measures. Just explicitly make them paragraphs `* Sidenote: yada yada.`. This regex can help you find any instances: `^[^ ]+: .`

76.0.0 4/19/2024
================
🎨 try using "rem" in CSS to better support the "zooming out" effect on a blog

The code below added to a page will create the zoom out effect:

css html {font-size: var(--base-font-size, 8px);}

⚠️ BREAKING: There might be some slight style breaks related to this change.

75.2.1 4/18/2024
================
🏥 style fix: removed top margin on headers when they are in the first section

75.2.0 4/18/2024
================
🎨 increased the default font-size from 14px to 16px
🎨 changed the font-family and line height of captions which previously looked off
🎨 adjusted margins on question h4s
🏥 fix slight line-height issue with datelines

75.1.1 4/16/2024
================
🏥 fix bug where quick links could not be used inside a footnote definition.

75.1.0 4/10/2024
================
🎉 Added `***` parser to print a Dinkus
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus

Now I will show an example.

***

Above is a dinkus.

75.0.0 4/06/2024

🏥 do not compile aftertext nodes having the "hidden" attribute

72.4.1 11/04/2023

🏥 fixed regression where `` was present in RSS pages. Thank you to Joao for the report.

72.4.0 6/27/2023
================
🎉 provide "dropcap" CSS class.
🎉 tweaked default styling of images and captions

This paragraph has a dropcap. It can be a useful visual aid for the reader to break up sections. You can read more about dropcaps on Wikipedia.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial

72.3.0 6/13/2023
================
🎉 if you want to disable `wrapsOn` you can now provide parameters to specify only the wraps you want, if any.
🏥 by default katex wraps won't run unless there is a `katex` node in a file. So any paragraph containing multiple $ will now behave as before katex wraps were added.

72.2.0 5/31/2023
================
🎉 added `wideColumns` parser

72.1.0 5/26/2023
================
🏥 Bold and italics are no longer parsed inside inline code `2*4*2` or inline $\KaTeX$ $X_{2_i}$.

72.0.0 5/25/2023

 - A single # is now h1, ## is h2, et cetera. `title` can be thought of as `h0`.
⚠️ BREAKING: `gazetteHeader` is now `pageHeader` and `gazetteFooter` is now `pageFooter`. Headers and footers can be independent of themes.

70.0.0 4/29/2023
================
🎉 Paragraphs no longer need to start with '* '. All non-blank lines that don't start with a defined parser are now treated as a paragraph. The catch-all is no longer an error. It is recommended to start all paragraphs with a capital letter, as in the future it may become the standard that parsers start with a lowercase or symbol, and you will avoid any future parser collisions.
 - Thanks to zoeartemis for the feedback.
 - No changes are needed but you can update your files with the find/replace combo: `\n\* ` `\n`.
  - You may want to use the case sensitive `\n\* [a-z]` search first to find any paragraphs that start with a lowercase letter.
  - You also want to be careful of any lines that would now start with `&lt;!`, as they will be parsed as HTML nodes.

69.3.0 4/26/2023
================
🎉 Add `katex` parser. KaTeX: "The fastest math typesetting library for the web."
 https://katex.org/

⚠️ BREAKING: `kpiTable` is now `dashboard`

66.0.0 4/2/2023
===============
⚠️ BREAKING: This upgrades to JTree 73 and Grammar 6. Any custom grammar files need to be updated (generally this just means a find/replace of `Node` to `Parser`).

65.0.0 3/30/2023
================
🎉 Upgrade to Jtree 71 to get Grammar 5 wiith scoped parsers.

64.0.0 3/28/2023

================
🏥 cache hotfix for embedded snippets.

63.0.0 3/27/2023
================
This was a big internal refactor to remove the outdated concept of `ScrollFolder` and rely on the file system parameter instead. This makes it easier to build webapps serving dynamic Scroll pages. It also simplifies the upcoming isomorphic release.
⚠️ BREAKING: Only users using Scroll as a module may be affected:
 - Removed `ScrollFolder`. Exports now include `ScrollDiskFileSystem` and `ScrollInMemoryFileSystem`. To get the same behavior as `new ScrollFolder("folder").buildFiles()` use `new ScrollDiskFileSystem().buildFilesInFolder("folder")`.
 - Instead of `new ScrollFolder(__dirname).defaultScrollCompiler` use `DefaultScrollCompiler`
⚠️ BREAKING: Only users using Scroll extensions may be affected:
 - In extensions `compileSnippet` should now be `compileEmbeddedVersion`
 - Instead of `file.folder.folder` use `file.folderPath`
⚠️ BREAKING: Only users using `loop` may be affected:
 - Temporarily renamed `relativeLink` to `linkRelativeToCompileTarget`

62.5.1 3/27/2023
================

61.0.0 3/11/2023
================

🎉 the `hidden` parser can now be used on any aftertext node
🏥 if there is no `permalink` on a file the `title` node won't output an a tag
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected). If you had put markup directives in your title tags, such as *bolds*, those will now actually be evaluated.
⚠️ BREAKING: `title` blocks now start a section like `#` and `##`, so you may need to add an empty line to end the section, for example if you previously had a `startColumns` right after the title tag.

56.1.0 2/8/2023
===============
🎉 `snippets` nodes can now accept multiple groups and also groups can be in different folders. Syntax is `[folderPath]/[groupName]` For example:

html 

54.1.0 1/19/2023
================
🏥 `scroll init` no longer starts with a `viewSourceBaseUrl`. If not provided then the View Source link is to the scroll file, so new sites don't start with broken links.

 https://scroll.pub
🎉 `youTube` nodes can now have captions.
🏥 fix: non-embed `youTube` links are converted to proper embed links to fix CORS issues.

⚠️ BREAKING: `note` parser under `link` nodes has been renamed to `title` and instead of it being a block just the line is used. This is to better reflect what it does. See example above.

53.0.2 1/18/2023

🏥 fix: `youTube` definition was missing a cell type for url.

53.0.1 1/17/2023

================
🏥 Upgrade JTree.

52.0.0 1/10/2023
================
🎉 API usage: new getter `buildNeeded` returns whether the folder needs to be rebuilt. You can use this to skip unnecessary builds for faster perf.
⚠️ BREAKING: This should not break anyone however behavior has changed. `scroll build` now does not overwrite unmodified files. Now `mtime` reflects when the generated HTML last changed instead of when the `scroll build` command was last run. This speeds up `rsync` deploys.

51.0.0 1/9/2023
===============
🎉 This version introduces the concept of `Sections`. Headers (`#`, `##` and `?`) now start a section, and a blank line ends it. A section will not be split across columns.

🏥 fixed body padding regression

47.0.0 11/28/2022
=================

⚠️ BREAKING: removed automatic meta tag generation. You now need to explicitly add a `metaTags` parser.
⚠️ BREAKING: removed ``, ``, ``, and `` tags. Unnecessary. Modern browsers don't need them. HTML never should have had head/body split.
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `SCROLL_CSS` export.

46.2.0 11/27/2022
=================
🏥 `stump` parser works now

46.1.0 11/27/2022

=================
This is a major breaking refactor. *All the implicit imports are gone*. Everything must be explicitly included now (perhaps with a few slight exceptions like meta tags). This migration guide is a work in progress. This release is NOT recommended for the feint of heart. Wait a day or two until the bugs are ironed out.

⚠️ BREAKING: removed `maxColumns` and `columnWidth` and `template`
⚠️ BREAKING: headers and footers are not provided by default. You now must explicitly include them with `scrollHeader` and `scrollFooter`. The previous behavior of `scrollHeader` and `scrollFooter` has been removed.
⚠️ BREAKING: columns are not provided by default. You now need to wrap your content in `startColumns` and `endColumns`.
⚠️ BREAKING: CSS is not included by default. You need to use the snippet parser `scrollCssTag`. The previous behavior of `scrollCss` has been removed. Also `printScrollCss` is now `scrollCss`.

45.0.0 11/24/2022
=================
🎉 a whole new way to do footnotes/end notes.

Footnotes example

=================
🎉 New: Linkify! Links like https://breckyunits.com and email addresses like feedback@scroll.pub are now compiled to HTML `a` tags automatically. Note: if an `a` tag is detected in the node Linkify will be DISABLED for that node.
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) slim chance linkify may insert links where you previously did not want them.

42.0.0 2022.11.09
=================
⚠️ BREAKING: `scroll check` is now `scroll test`

41.0.0 2022.11.08

=================
⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) `caption` now extends the thought (`*`) node.

[Image Omitted]

39.0.0 2022.11.03
=================
⚠️ BREAKING: `scroll init` no longer creates a `feed.xml` file by default. You can easily add an XML feed manually with the 2 steps below:

The goal of this release is to simplify and speed up Scroll by removing legacy features.
This is a major release that removes a bunch of the original parsers in favor of the newer more advanced aftertext nodes.
If you don't want to upgrade at this time, it's very easy to just add the removed grammar definitions from this commit into your existing scrolls using the normal extension pattern.
You can also easily alias the newer aftertext node types with the original parsers above if you'd prefer.

36.1.0 2022.10.27
=================
🎉 Now you can leave the "pattern" part blank in link node in aftertext to make the whole line a link.

A Header
========

A Subheader
===========

Have you thought of the most important question?
================================================

31.4.1 2022.9.3
===============
🏥 and that is why you always run the tests.

31.4.0 2022.9.3
===============
🎉 New parsers: `*`, `footnote`, and `readingList`

This is a _thought_. It's like a condensed form of aftertext with *bold* and _italics_ and `code` turned on by default.

Reading lists
=============
Projects I'm very actively working on:

31.3.0 2022.9.3
===============
🏥 Fixed bad regression where only the first word of a replacement line was getting replaced.

31.2.0 2022.9.2
===============

================
⚠️ BREAKING: upgraded to jtree 56. This is not likely to break anyone. However, if you are extending Scroll with your own nodeTypes you will need to make sure that your abstract nodes (and *only* your abstract nodes) have an id that begins with `abstract`. You can then remove all occurrences of the parser `abstract` from your grammar node definitions.

30.1.1 2022.8.30
================
🎉 Improve header message thanks to dg's feedback

30.1.0 2022.8.29

28.1.0 2022.8.26
================
🏥 imports can now be recursive

28.0.0 2022.8.26
================
This is a *major* update that radically simplifies Scroll and adds significant new capabilities.

From 3 file types to 1
======================

`scroll.settings` and `*.grammar` files are gone. Everything is now done with `.scroll` files, and now every parser is documented and usable on try.scroll.com and type checked.

Imports and variables
=====================

Use `import [filepath]` to import one file into another. Use `replace` and `replaceDefault` for variables.

Add your own Grammar extensions directly in your Scroll files
=============================================================

Define new nodeTypes or create your own aliases on a per file basis. Use the import parser and build your own collection of common reusable node types for your project(s).

Unlimited Groups and Group Pages
================================

Add files to one or more groups and then customize how each group page prints. No more magic or implicit creation of collection pages.

Multiple Compiler Passes
========================

The new language features (imports, grammar nodes, and variables) required a change from a 1 one stage compilation process to a multi-stage compiler pass pattern. The compilers passes run in this order: imports, grammar extensions, then variables. So variables cannot be used in imports or grammar extensions.

Change list
===========

⚠️ BREAKING: The `git` setting is renamed to `viewSourceBaseUrl`
⚠️ BREAKING: The `sourceLink` setting is renamed to `viewSourceUrl`
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `skipIndexPage`. Instead you now opt-in to group pages like this: `groups index.html`
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `scroll.settings` concept. Use `import settings.scroll` now.
⚠️ BREAKING: `footer` is now `scrollFooter` and `header` is now `scrollHeader`
⚠️ BREAKING: removed `ignoreGrammarFiles`. Custom grammar extensions must now be explicitly imported and/or be in `.scroll` files.
⚠️ BREAKING: changed link text from "Article source" to "View source"
⚠️ BREAKING: `css` setting is now `scrollCss`
⚠️ BREAKING: DefaultScrollScriptCompiler is now DefaultScrollCompiler
⚠️ BREAKING: removed buildSinglePages, buildIndexPage, buildSnippetsPage, buildRssFeed, and buildCssFile. Everything done by `buildFiles` now. See 'full.scroll', `index.scroll`, `feed.scroll`, and `style.scroll` in `tests/kitchenSink` for how to implement those in new pattern.
⚠️ BREAKING: in default theme CSS some class names have changed:

scrollArticleDateComponent => scrollDateComponent
scrollArticlePageComponent => scrollFilePageComponent
scrollSingleArticleTitle => scrollFilePageTitle
scrollIndexPageArticleContainerComponent => scrollGroupPageFileContainerComponent
scrollArticleSourceLinkComponent => scrollFileViewSourceUrlComponent
scrollIndexPageComponent => scrollGroupPageComponent
scrollIndexPageFileContainerComponent => scrollGroupPageFileContainerComponent

⚠️ just calling ScrollScript Scroll again unless it becomes confusing

Wikipedia|https://wikipedia.org

⚠️ the first paragraph of an article no longer prints a dateline. Use aftertext instead. See example below.

By default the article's date will be used but you can also provide a custom date.

February 21, 2020

A truck transporting llamas collided into a pajama factory late last night.

🎉 add belowAsCode and aboveAsCode
🎉 split base grammar into files for easier extensibility

Can you show an example of aftertext?
=====================================

You write some text. After your text, you add your markup instructions with selectors to select the text to markup, one command per line. For example, this paragraph is written in Aftertext and the source code looks like:

22.4.0 2021.11.25
=================
🎉 add basic caption support to images

[Image Omitted]
 This is a caption

🎉 new subsection nodetype. Simply compiles to an h4 for now but more semantic this way.
⚠️ title2-title6 have been removed. use question, section and subsection instead.

Why the new `question` nodes?
=============================

Question and answer structures are literally older than the Socratic Method. Such a common semantic pattern deserves it's own parsers.

How do I migrate from title# nodes?
===================================

The below regex may help.

Find ^title\d (.+\?)
 ReplaceWith question $1
Find ^title\d (.+)
 ReplaceWith section $1

🎉 skipIndexPage nodeType

How do I use the new single word links?
=======================================

For single word links in paragraph nodes only (for now) you can now do:

paragraph
 This is a link🔗example.com

Below is a regex for migrating existing *.scroll files.

([^ ]+)
$2🔗$1

How do I use the 🔗link tag with multiword links?
=================================================

The 🔗link tag only supports single word links. Like everything with ScrollScript, you have a number of options if the conventional design doesn't work for you. Your options are:

- 1. Link just one word. If you need more, perhaps camelCase or snake_case your words together into one concept.
- 2. Repeat the link twice foo 🔗link bar 🔗link
- 3. Use &lt;a> tags.
- 4. Extend the ScrollScript grammar for your site.

Can I not include a page in the index page?
===========================================
Now you can! Sometimes you just want to publish an independent page without including it in the index. To do that, just add `skipIndexPage`.

12.1.0 2021.05.14
