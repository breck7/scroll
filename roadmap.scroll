A list of what is ahead for Scroll. Scroll is written in ScrollParsers, so will also benefit from the planned improvements in the ScrollParsers Roadmap.

# Official Language Spec
- A Spec defining the core of Scroll in enough detail so someone could build a new implementation in any host language.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_specification Spec

# Typeset Output: Scroll → TeX → PDF
- It should be easy to use Scroll to generate not only HTML files but also nice PDFs likely using TeX as an intermediate representation

# Browser Version: scroll.browser.js
- https://try.scroll.pub is limited and hacked together. A browser version should be shipped in this npm package and it should support adding Scroll Parsers so people can use the full power of Scroll completely in the client.

# Potential Switching to Imperative Paradigm
- Scroll is currently mostly declarative, with a few imperative keywords. However, it may be a better design to make it explicitly imperative. Though that might make it worse, sending it in the direction of a computer/scripting language, rather than the direction trying to be closer to the true language of thought. For now it remains declarative.
