Scroll Roadmap
==============

What major improvements are coming next?
========================================

Official Language Spec
======================
- A Spec defining the core of Scroll in enough detail so someone could build a new implementation in any host language.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_specification

Typeset Output: Scroll → TeX → PDF
==================================
- It should be easy to use Scroll to generate not only HTML files but also nice PDFs likely using TeX as an intermediate representation

Browser Version: scroll.browser.js
==================================
- https://try.scroll.pub is limited and hacked together. A browser version should be shipped in this npm package and it should support adding Parsers so people can use the full power of Scroll completely in the client.

Potential Switching to Imperative Paradigm
==========================================
- Scroll is currently mostly declarative, with a few imperative keywords. However, it may be a better design to make it explicitly imperative. Though that might make it worse, sending it in the direction of a computer/scripting language, rather than the direction trying to be closer to the true language of thought. For now it remains declarative.

In addition to the above, Scroll is written in Parsers and will get all the planned improvements in the Parsers Roadmap as well.
