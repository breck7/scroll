Scroll Roadmap
==============

What major improvements are coming next?
========================================

Official Language Spec
======================
- A Spec defining the core of Scroll in enough detail so someone could build a new implementation in any host language.

Build Typeset PDFs Output: Scroll → TeX → PDF. Also ePubs.
==========================================================
- It should be easy to use Scroll to generate not only HTML files but also nice ePubs and PDFs (likely using TeX as an intermediate representation)

Browser Version: scroll.browser.js
==================================
- https://try.scroll.pub is limited and hacked together. A browser version should be shipped in this npm package and it should support adding Parsers so people can use the full power of Scroll completely in the client.

In addition to the above, Scroll is written in Parsers and will get all the planned improvements in the Parsers Roadmap as well.
