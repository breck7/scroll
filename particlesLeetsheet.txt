Particles LeetSheet
===================

*Particle Syntax* is a syntax-free syntax for splitting files into particles (separated by line breaks) which can have atoms (separated by spaces) and subparticles (indented lines).

- Every line is a particle and every particle is one line.
- Newlines separate particles.
- The atoms in a particle are separated by a single space.
- An indent of +1 space makes a particle a subparticle of the parent line.
- Particles has no syntax errors; every document is a valid Particles document.
