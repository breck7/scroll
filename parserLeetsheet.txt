Parsers LeetSheet
=================

*Parsers* is the advanced language Scroll developers use to extend the Scroll language with new parsers. Parsers files end in *.parsers*.

// - A comment.
baseParser - In rare cases with untyped content you can use a blobParser, for now, to skip parsing for performance gains. The base errorParser will report errors when parsed. Use that if you don't want to implement your own error parser.
boolean - Assign a constant to a parser which will be available in the compiled parser classes.
catchAllCellType - Aka 'listCellType'. Use this when the value in a key/value pair is a list. If there are extra words in the node's line, parse these words as this type. Often used with `listDelimiterParser`.
catchAllParser - If a parser is not found in the inScope list, instantiate this type of node instead.
cellParser - prefix/postfix/omnifix parsing strategy. If missing, defaults to prefix.
cells - Describes the word type of each word in the line.
childrenKey - Advanced keyword to help with serialization/deserialization of blobs. If present will serialize the node to an object and set a property with this key and the value set to the node's children.
compiler - 
compilesTo - Optionally specify a file extension that will be used when compiling your language to a file. Generally used on parsers marked root.
contentKey - Advanced keyword to help with isomorphic JSON serialization/deserialization. If present will serialize the node to an object and set a property with this key and the value set to the node's content.
crux - Attach by matching first word.
cruxFromId - Derive crux from parserId.
description - Parser description.
example - Provide a one line description and then a snippet of example code.
extends - Extend another parser.
extensions - File extensions of your language. Generally used for parsers marked "root". Sometimes your language might have multiple extensions. If you don't add this, the root node's parserId will be used as the default file extension.
float - Assign a constant to a parser which will be available in the compiled parser classes.
frequency - 
inScope - Parsers in scope.
int - Assign a constant to a parser which will be available in the compiled parser classes.
javascript - Specify javascript code for Parser Actions.
listDelimiter - Split content by this delimiter.
pattern - Attach via regex.
required - Assert is present at least once.
root - Mark a parser as root if it is the root of your programming language. The parserId will be the name of your language. The parserId will also serve as the default file extension, if you don't specify another. If more than 1 parser is marked as "root", the last one wins.
single - Assert used once.
string - Assign a constant to a parser which will be available in the compiled parser classes.
tags - 
uniqueFirstWord - Assert unique first words. For pattern parsers.
uniqueLine - Assert unique lines. For pattern parsers.
version - Version number of your language. Generally used on parsers marked root.
