question Who is Scroll for?

aftertext
 Scroll is built for people who like writing, open source, git backed static site generators, and fast simple code.

question What makes Scroll different?

replace TreeNotationLinked <a href="https://treenotation.org">Tree Notation</a>
replace GrammarLinked <a href="https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20grammar">Grammar</a>

aftertext
 Scroll is not just another static site generator but also a *new language*. More than that‚Äîit's a simple, magical new language that you can extend in amazing ways. Scroll is mostly written in a new language called GrammarLinked, and both Grammar and Scroll are built on a new revolutionarily simple new syntax called TreeNotationLinked.

aftertext
 The basics of Scroll are even simpler than Markdown. For example, the keyword for title is title.
 italics the keyword for title is title

aftertext
 You can stick to the basics or easily define new keywords extending the language to better fit your content and workflows. A simple indent is all you need to include sublanguages. No complex encoding needed.

question How do I extend Scroll?

aftertext
 Imagine you run a cooking blog where you share recipes. It may be useful to present recipes to your readers in a specialized style. You could create a recipe keyword and write a post like this:
 italics recipe

code
 title My Snowball Cookies
 
 paragraph
  Bet you can't eat just one!
 
 recipe
  ingredients
   6 large eggs
   1/2 cup sugar
  step Beat eggs until foamy
  step Add sugar
  step Heat oven to 350 degrees
  step Bake for 10 minutes

aftertext
 Notice that your post uses the keyword `recipe`, but Scroll does not have a keyword for that. No problem, just define it yourself using the Grammar Language, extending your dialect of Scroll:
 wrapsOn

code
 recipeNode
  extends abstractScrollNode
  javascript
   compile() {
     const addYourSpecialMagic = ""
     return `<div>${addYourSpecialMagic}</div>`
   }

aftertext
 Your extension might generate beautiful custom HTML for that recipe section and also perhaps allow users to vote on it, or include it in a CSV export, et cetera. Scroll let's you combine mini-languages in a simple and non-conflicting way. What you do with those languages is up to you.

aftertext
 (Diclosure: the cookie recipe above has not been taste tested)

question What kind of sites can I use Scroll to build?

aftertext
 Scroll is a great solution for blogs and sites of one page, a few pages, tens of pages, hundreds of pages, or even thousands of pages.
 link https://scroll.pub one page
 link https://scroll.pub/blog/ a few pages
 link https://breckyunits.com/code/ tens of pages
 link https://breckyunits.com/ hundreds of pages
 link https://pldb.com/ thousands of pages

question How do I get Scroll?

aftertext
 The instant way is to try Scroll in GitPod.
 link https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/breck7/scroll GitPod

aftertext
 Scroll is a command line app you install on your local machine. Scroll requires basic familiarity with the command line
 and NodeJs >=14. If you do not have NodeJs, Mac/Linux users can install NodeJs with #n# and Windows users can install NodeJs with Scoop.
 link https://nodejs.org NodeJs
 wrap # https://github.com/tj/n
 https://scoop.sh/ Scoop

aftertext
 If you would like to use Scroll but aren't familiar with the command
 line, please open an issue and we may be able to help.

aftertext
 Once you have NodeJs installed you can install from GitHub or npm. Scroll is scroll-cli on npm.
 link https://www.npmjs.com/package/scroll-cli scroll-cli

aftertext
 You can install from GitHub:

code
 git clone https://github.com/breck7/scroll
 cd scroll
 npm install -g .

aftertext
 Or you can install Scroll with npm by typing:

code
 npm install -g scroll-cli

question How do I use Scroll?

aftertext
 Scroll is a command line app. To see the commands type:

code

question Where do I get help?

aftertext
 Post an issue in this GitHub or email us.
 email feedback@scroll.pub us

question What are some example sites using Scroll?

aftertext
 Scroll currently powers blog and sites of one page, a few pages, tens of pages, hundreds of pages, and even thousands of pages.
 link https://scroll.pub one page
 link https://scroll.pub/blog/ a few pages
 link https://breckyunits.com/code/ tens of pages
 link https://breckyunits.com/ hundreds of pages
 link https://pldb.com/ thousands of pages

question What does a typical project folder look like?

aftertext
 A typical Scroll project folder, excluding the html files
 built by Scroll, looks like this:

code
 üìÅyourDomainName.org
  about.scroll
  feed.scroll
  firstPost.scroll
  index.scroll
  settings.scroll
  anImageInTheArticle.png 

aftertext
 When you run `scroll build`, Scroll reads those files and generates
 the outputs right in that site's folder.
 wrapsOn

aftertext
 With Scroll your site's Scroll files and static files and generated html
 are all in one public folder and checked into version control. Usually you
 want to add `*.html` and `feed.xml` to your `.gitignore`.
 wrapsOn
 
question How do I save drafts?

aftertext
 Have a drafts folder next to your published scroll. For example:

code
 üìÅdrafts
  someDraft.scroll
 üìÅyourDomainName.org
  publishedArticle.scroll

question What file formats does Scroll use?

aftertext
 Scroll articles are written as Scroll files with the file
 extension scroll. The current base grammar for Scroll is defined here.
 code scroll
 https://github.com/breck7/scroll/tree/main/grammar here

question What language is Scroll written in?

aftertext
 Scroll is mostly written in GrammarLinked. The Scroll CLI app is written in plain Javascript and
 runs in Node.js. Scroll makes heavy use of Tree Languages. The CSS is
 written in Hakon. The HTML is written in stump.
 link https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20hakon Hakon
 link https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20stump stump

aftertext
 TypeScript is not used in the Scroll repo and because the Javascript is only ~1kloc that likely will not be necessary.

question How does versioning of articles work?

aftertext
 Scroll is designed for git. A single article is stored as
 a single file tracked by git.

question Is Scroll public domain?

aftertext
 Yes! Scroll is also 100% focused on helping people build internal or <strong>public domain sites</strong> and everything is designed with that assumption.

question Why does the default theme have a single page layout?

aftertext
 The default Scroll theme is designed to make it easier for *syntopic reading*. Being able to scan the page like a newspaper. This allows you to read at a higher level‚Äîto "get in the author's head"‚Äîcompared to reading one article at a time from beginning to end.
 wrapsOn

aftertext
 And if anyone prefers to read a scroll in a different way‚Äîthey can! Scroll is for
 public domain sites. People are free to arrange the symbols any way they wish.

question Will you make design decisions for non-public domain sites?

aftertext
 No.

question Can I use Scroll for internal private sites not intended for publishing?

aftertext
 Yes!

question In the single page layout why don't you have only the newest articles above the fold?

aftertext
 This was originally a bug. But then it turns out to be a feature, as it
 gives older articles, which are often more important, more visibility.

question Is there a place I can play with the Scroll grammar?

aftertext
 Yes. In the Tree Language Designer.
 https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer#url%20https%3A%2F%2Ftry.scroll.pub%2FscrollScript.grammar Tree Language Designer

question What's an easy way to have GitHub run Scroll and build my HTML files automatically?

aftertext
 Go to your project folder and create the file below:

code
 mkdir -p .github/workflows
 touch .github/workflows/buildAndDeployScroll.yaml

aftertext
 Then open that file and paste in this code:

code
 # Adapted from https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action
 name: Build and Deploy Scroll
 on:
   push:
     branches:
       - main
 jobs:
   build-and-deploy:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
         uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.1
       - name: Install and Build
         run: |
           npm install scroll-cli
           ./node_modules/scroll-cli/scroll.js build
           # Uncomment the line below if you are ignoring *.html files in your gitignore file
           # rm .gitignore
       - name: Deploy üöÄ
         uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4
         with:
           branch: scroll-output # The branch the action should deploy to.
           folder: .

aftertext
 Commit and push. Now go to your GitHub Repo and then Settings, then Pages, and select the scroll-output branch as the Source for the pages. Click save. Your built site should be live.
 code Settings
 code Pages
 code scroll-output

question How do I check for broken links?

aftertext
 Scroll does not check for broken links. For that, try linkinator.
 link https://github.com/JustinBeckwith/linkinator linkinator

code
 # npm install -g linkinator
 linkinator https://scroll.pub > brokenLinks.txt

question How do I check browser performance?

aftertext
 Scroll does not have browser perf tools built in. For that, try lighthouse.
 link https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse lighthouse

code
 # npm install -g lighthouse
 lighthouse https://scroll.pub --output-path scrollBrowserPerf.html; open scrollBrowserPerf.html

question Where should I host my site?

aftertext
 Any web server works. You can even host your scroll for free using GitHub Pages, just like this site.
 https://pages.github.com GitHub Pages

question How do I use Scroll with a custom domain?

aftertext
 Just buy a domain and point it to your web server or web host (such as GitHub Pages). Google Domains is where this domain is registered and is a great service.
 https://domains.google Google Domains

question How can I deploy my site?

aftertext
 If you have your own web server try rsync. Here's a bash one liner:

code
 # deploy.sh
 # swap "/var/www/html" with the path to your website's location on your web server
 rsync -vr /[path/to/your/site]/* [yourdomain.com]:/var/www/html

aftertext
 Add a section like the one below to your ~.ssh/config to save your username and correct key pair.
 link https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/494483/specifying-an-identityfile-with-ssh section

code
 Host example.com
   User yourUserName
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/example_id_rsa
   IdentitiesOnly yes

question How can I output my Scroll to an EPUB file?

aftertext
 Pandoc is one way to do it. If you are on a Mac and have Homebrew installed:
 link https://brew.sh Homebrew

code
 brew install pandoc
 pandoc index.html -o book.epub

question How can I track web traffic?

aftertext
 Scroll emits HTML with zero Javascript and does not have any tracking or cookies. If you are using a web server like Nginx you might have some access logs on your server. The one liner below uses GoAccess to summarize recent Nginx access logs.
 link https://goaccess.io GoAccess

code
 # apt-get install goaccess
 goaccess /var/log/nginx/access.log -o /var/www/html/YOUR_SECRET_REPORT_URL.html --log-format=COMBINED --real-time-html --ws-url=wss://YOURDOMAIN.com

question Does Scroll support RSS?

aftertext
 Yes! Just create a `feed.scroll` file like this.
 https://github.com/breck7/scroll/blob/main/public/blog/feed.scroll this
 wrapsOn

question Does Scroll support categories and category pages?

aftertext
 Yes! Just add your page to a category by using the `groups` keyword and then creating a `yourGroupName.scroll` page for the group. See a demo here.
 wrapsOn
 https://github.com/breck7/scroll/blob/main/public/blog/ here

question Does Scroll support Open Graph tags for better social media sharing?

aftertext
 Yes. By default the first image and first paragraph of an article will be used for the "og:" tags. Unfortunately Twitter doesn't support relative image links so you need to specify `baseUrl`. For more help check out the debuggers from Facebook and Twitter.
 wrapsOn

question Does Scroll support themes and templates?

aftertext
 Yes! Scroll includes a simple API for changing the style of your site. This is an active area of development so please reach out if you'd like to customize the look of your Scroll.

question How can I build a scroll from a Twitter account?

aftertext
 Hopefully someone will build a package or site that does this. For now, on your Twitter settings, download an archive of your data and convert the tweets JSON into scroll files. Or to experiment faster use this tool to grab some tweets as a TSV.
 link https://www.vicinitas.io/free-tools/download-user-tweets tool

question What were some alternatives considered?

aftertext
 There was no publishing software that reads and writes Scroll yet
 so building Scroll was necessary. Jekyll and Brecksblog were the two biggest inspirations.

 link https://github.com/breck7/brecksblog Brecksblog

question What has changed in recent versions?

aftertext
 View the releaseNotes.

section Contributing to Scroll development

question How do I contribute?

aftertext
 File issues. Share your Scroll sites.

aftertext
 You can submit pull requests too. The shorter the better.

question How do I debug node.js performance?

code
 # cd your_slow_scroll
 # you may need to update the path below so it points to your scroll code
 node --cpu-prof --cpu-prof-name=scrollNodePerf.cpuprofile ~/scroll/scroll.js build
 # Now ‚û°Ô∏è open a new Chrome tab ‚û°Ô∏è open devtools ‚û°Ô∏è click Performance ‚û°Ô∏è click "Load Profile..." ‚û°Ô∏è select your scrollNodePerf.cpuprofile

question How is a keyword different than a web components?

aftertext
 Scroll and Web Components are similar in that both empower users to define their own reusable components. But Scroll is higher level than web components. For example, in addition to easily targetting HTML and web components, Scroll also plays really nicely with version control and 2D editors. Scroll encourages encoding semantic content with as little noise as possible, which creates benefits in many places.

question How do I run cross browser tests?

aftertext
 For that we use BrowserStack.
 link https://browserstack.com BrowserStack

question Why the name Scroll?

aftertext
 The scroll was invented thousands of years ago and scrolls are still useful today. Scroll has been designed with a focus on simplicity and a goal of making something that would have been useful decades ago, with the hope that this will make it useful decades into the future.
