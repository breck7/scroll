question What makes Scroll different?

aftertext
 Scroll is different than other static site generators because it uses the easily extendible Scrolldown, so you can invent new languages to better fit your content.
 bold Scrolldown
 https://staticsitegenerators.net other static site generators

aftertext
 The basics of Scrolldown are even simpler than Markdown. For example, the keyword for title is title.
 italics the keyword for title is title

paragraph
 You can stick to the basics or easily define new keywords to better fit your content and workflows. A simple indent is all you need to include sublanguages. No complex encoding needed.

question How do I extend Scroll?

aftertext
 Imagine you run a cooking blog where you share recipes. It may be useful to present recipes to your readers in a specialized style. You could create a recipe keyword and write a post like this:
 italics recipe

code
 title My Snowball Cookies
 
 paragraph
  Bet you can't eat just one!
 
 recipe
  ingredients
   6 large eggs
   1/2 cup sugar
  step Beat eggs until foamy
  step Add sugar
  step Heat oven to 350 degrees
  step Bake for 10 minutes

paragraph
 Your grammar extension might generate beautiful custom HTML for that recipe section and also perhaps allow users to vote on it, or include it in a CSV export, et cetera. Scrolldown let's you combine mini-languages in a simple and non-conflicting way. What you do with those languages is up to you.

paragraph
 (Warning: the cookies above have not been tasted)

paragraph
 For an extended example of extending Scroll check out this one🔗github.com/breck7/breckyunits.com/tree/main/markups which adds node types for Markdown, Textile, and BBCode.

question What kind of sites can I use Scroll to build?

paragraph
 Scroll work great for blogs, collaborative databases, newspapers, intranets and other types of static sites as well.

question How do I get Scroll?

paragraph
 The instant way is to try Scroll in GitPod🔗gitpod.io/#https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll.

paragraph
 Scroll is a command line app you install on your local machine. Scroll requires basic familiarity with the command line
 and NodeJs🔗nodejs.org >=14. If you do not have NodeJs on your machine, one
 way is to install n🔗github.com/tj/n which makes it easy to get NodeJs.

paragraph
 If you would like to use Scroll but aren't familiar with the command
 line, please open an issue and we may be able to help.

paragraph
 Once you have NodeJs installed you can install from GitHub or npm. Scroll is scroll-cli🔗www.npmjs.com/package/scroll-cli on npm.

paragraph
 You can install from GitHub:

code
 git clone https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll
 cd scroll
 npm install -g .

paragraph
 Or you can install Scroll with npm by typing:

code
 npm install -g scroll-cli

question Where do I get help?

aftertext
 Post an issue in this GitHub or email us.
 email scroll@publicdomaincompany.com us

question What are some example sites using Scroll?

paragraph
 This page, BreckYunits.com🔗breckyunits.com and TreeDB🔗treebase.treenotation.org/treedb/.

question What does the name Scroll refer to?

aftertext
 A scroll is a single folder containing Scrolldown files and an optional scroll.settings file.
 Scroll compiles those Scrolldown files into a static index.html page.
 italics A scroll
 code scroll.settings

paragraph
 Scroll is also the name of the command line app that includes a
 simple fs watch app for live preview.

paragraph
 Scrolldown is the name of a Tree Language defined in this grammar🔗github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll/blob/main/scrolldown.grammar.

question What does a typical project folder look like?

paragraph
 A typical Scroll project folder, excluding the html files
 built by Scroll, looks like this:

code
 📁yourDomainName.org
  about.scroll
  publishedArticle.scroll
  anImageInTheArticle.png
  scroll.settings

aftertext
 When you build a Scroll site, you are simply generating
 the index.html and [article].html files in the site's folder.
 code index.html
 code [article].html

aftertext
 With Scroll your site's Scroll files and static files and generated html
 are all in one public folder and checked into version control. Usually you
 want to add *.html to your .gitignore.
 code *.html
 code .gitignore
 
question How do I save drafts?

paragraph
 Have a draft scroll next to your published scroll. For example:

code
 📁drafts
  someDraft.scroll
 📁yourDomainName.org
  publishedArticle.scroll

question What file formats does Scroll use?

aftertext
 Scroll articles are written as Scrolldown files with the file
 extension scroll. The current base grammar for Scrolldown is defined here.
 code scroll
 https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll/blob/main/scrolldown.grammar here

question What language is Scroll written in?

paragraph
 The Scroll CLI app is written in plain Javascript and
 runs in Node.js. Scroll makes heavy use of Tree Languages. The CSS is
 written in Hakon🔗jtree.treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20hakon.
 The HTML is written in stump🔗jtree.treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20stump.

paragraph
 TypeScript may be used in the future but Scroll may
 never get over 1kloc so that might not be necessary.

question How does versioning of articles work?

paragraph
 Scroll is designed for git. A single article is stored as
 a single file tracked by git.

question Is Scroll public domain?

paragraph
 Yes! Scroll is also 100% focused on helping people build internal or <strong>public domain sites</strong> and everything is designed with that assumption.

question Why does the default theme have a single page layout?

aftertext
 The default Scroll theme is designed to make it easier for syntopic reading. Being able to scan the page like a newspaper. This allows you to read at a higher level—to "get in the author's head"—compared to reading one article at a time from beginning to end.
 bold syntopic reading

paragraph
 And if anyone prefers to read a scroll in a different way—they can! Scroll is for
 public domain sites. People are free to arrange the symbols any way they wish.

question Will you make design decisions for non-public domain sites?

paragraph
 No.

question Can I use Scroll for internal private sites not intended for publishing?

paragraph
 Yes!

question In the single page layout why don't you have only the newest articles above the fold?

paragraph
 This was originally a bug. But then it turns out to be a feature, as it
 gives older articles, which are often more important, more visibility.

question Is there a place I can play with the Scrolldown grammar and see how it compiles to HTML?

aftertext
 Yes. In the Tree Language Designer.
 https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer#url%20https%3A%2F%2Fscroll.pub%2Fscrolldown.grammar Tree Language Designer

question What's an easy way to have GitHub run Scroll and build my HTML files automatically?

paragraph
 Go to your project folder and create the file below:

code
 mkdir -p .github/workflows
 touch .github/workflows/buildAndDeployScroll.yaml

paragraph
 Then open that file and paste in this code:

code
 # Adapted from https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action
 name: Build and Deploy Scroll
 on:
   push:
     branches:
       - main
 jobs:
   build-and-deploy:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - name: Checkout 🛎️
         uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.1
       - name: Install and Build
         run: |
           npm install scroll-cli
           ./node_modules/scroll-cli/scroll.js build
           # Uncomment the line below if you are ignoring *.html files in your gitignore file
           # rm .gitignore
       - name: Deploy 🚀
         uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4
         with:
           branch: scroll-output # The branch the action should deploy to.
           folder: .

aftertext
 Commit and push. Now go to your GitHub Repo and then Settings, then Pages, and select the scroll-output branch as the Source for the pages. Click save. Your built site should be live.
 code Settings
 code Pages
 code scroll-output

question How do I check for broken links?

paragraph
 Scroll does not check for broken links. For that, try linkinator🔗github.com/JustinBeckwith/linkinator.

code
 # npm install -g linkinator
 linkinator https://scroll.pub > brokenLinks.txt

question How do I check browser performance?

paragraph
 Scroll does not have browser perf tools built in. For that, try lighthouse🔗github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse.

code
 # npm install -g lighthouse
 lighthouse https://scroll.pub --output-path scrollBrowserPerf.html; open scrollBrowserPerf.html

question Where should I host my site?

aftertext
 Any web server works. You can even host your scroll for free using GitHub Pages, just like this site.
 https://pages.github.com GitHub Pages

question How do I use Scroll with a custom domain?

aftertext
 Just buy a domain and point it to your web server or web host (such as GitHub Pages). Google Domains is where this domain is registered and is a great service.
 https://domains.google Google Domains

question How can I deploy my site?

paragraph
 If you have your own web server try rsync. Here's a bash one liner:

code
 # deploy.sh
 # swap "/var/www/html" with the path to your website's location on your web server
 rsync -vr /[path/to/your/site]/* [yourdomain.com]:/var/www/html

paragraph
 Add a section🔗unix.stackexchange.com/questions/494483/specifying-an-identityfile-with-ssh like the one below to your ~.ssh/config to save your username and correct key pair.

code
 Host example.com
   User yourUserName
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/example_id_rsa
   IdentitiesOnly yes

question How can I output my Scroll to an EPUB file?

paragraph
 Pandoc is one way to do it. If you are on a Mac and have Homebrew🔗brew.sh installed:

code
 brew install pandoc
 pandoc index.html -o book.epub

question How can I track web traffic?

paragraph
 Scroll emits HTML with zero Javascript and does not have any tracking or cookies. If you are using a web server like Nginx you might have some access logs on your server. The one liner below uses GoAccess🔗goaccess.io to summarize recent Nginx access logs.

code
 # apt-get install goaccess
 goaccess /var/log/nginx/access.log -o /var/www/html/YOUR_SECRET_REPORT_URL.html --log-format=COMBINED --real-time-html --ws-url=wss://YOURDOMAIN.com

question Does Scroll support Open Graph tags for better social media sharing?

aftertext
 Yes. By default the first image and first paragraph of an article will be used for the "og:" tags. Unfortunately Twitter doesn't support relative image links so you need to specify baseUrl in your scroll.settings file. For more help check out the debuggers from Facebook and Twitter.
 code baseUrl
 code scroll.settings
 https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug Facebook
 https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator Twitter

question Does Scroll support themes?

paragraph
 Yes! Scroll includes a simple API for changing the style of your site. This is an active area of development so please reach out if you'd like to customize the look of your Scroll.

question How can I build a scroll from a Twitter account?

paragraph
 Hopefully someone will build a package or site that does this. For now, on your Twitter settings, download an archive of your data and convert the tweets JSON into scroll files. Or to experiment faster use this tool🔗www.vicinitas.io/free-tools/download-user-tweets to grab some tweets as a TSV.

question What were some alternatives considered?

paragraph
 There was no publishing software that reads and writes Scrolldown yet
 so building Scroll was necessary. Jekyll🔗jekyllrb.com
 and Brecksblog🔗github.com/breck7/brecksblog were the two
 biggest inspirations.

question What has changed in recent versions?

paragraph
 View the releaseNotes🔗./releaseNotes.html.

section Contributing to Scroll development

question How do I contribute?

paragraph
 File issues. Share your Scroll sites.

paragraph
 You can submit pull requests too. The shorter the better.

question How do I debug node.js performance?

code
 # cd your_slow_scroll
 # you may need to update the path below so it points to your scroll code
 node --cpu-prof --cpu-prof-name=scrollNodePerf.cpuprofile ~/scroll/scroll.js build
 # Now ➡️ open a new Chrome tab ➡️ open devtools ➡️ click Performance ➡️ click "Load Profile..." ➡️ select your scrollNodePerf.cpuprofile

question How is a keyword different than a web components?

paragraph
 Scrolldown and Web Components are similar in that both empower users to define their own reusable components. But Scrolldown is higher level than web components. For example, in addition to easily targetting HTML and web components, Scrolldown also plays really nicely with version control and 2D editors. Scrolldown encourages encoding semantic content with as little noise as possible, which creates benefits in many places.

question How do I format the Scrolldown Grammar file?

code
 # Assuming you've already done `jtree register YOUR_PATH/jtree/langs/grammar/grammar.grammar`
 jtree format scrolldown.grammar

question How do I run cross browser tests?

paragraph
 For that we use BrowserStack🔗browserstack.com.
