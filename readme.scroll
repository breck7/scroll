title4 What makes Scroll different?

paragraph
 Instead of a page per post, like a blog, a Scroll is a
 <strong>single page</strong>, like an old newspaper.

paragraph
 Instead of Markdown, Scrolls uses <a
 href="https://treenotation.org/"><strong>Tree Notation</strong></a>,
 which makes it easy to combine languages to generate more
 creative content.

paragraph
 Instead of supporting licenses, Scroll is 100% focused on
 <strong>public domain sites</strong> and everything is
 designed with that assumption.

title4 How do I get Scroll?

paragraph
 Scroll is <a
 href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/scroll-cli">scroll-cli on npm</a>.

title4 How does Scroll work?

paragraph
 <em>A Scroll</em> is a single folder containing Scroll files.
 Scroll compiles those Scroll files into a static
 index.html page.

paragraph
 Scroll is also the name of the command line app that includes a
 simple Node.js Express app for live preview.

paragraph
 Scroll is also the name of a Tree Language defined in this <a href="https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll/blob/master/scroll/scroll.grammar">grammar</a>.

title4 What does a typical project folder look like?

paragraph
 A typical Scroll project folder looks like this:

code
 yourProject/
  someDraft.scroll
  readme.scroll
  yourDomainName.org/
   about.scroll
   publishedArticle.scroll
   anImageInTheArticle.png
   index.html
   scrollSettings.map

paragraph
 The `scrollSettings.map` file let's Scroll know that
 a folder contains a Scroll.

paragraph
 When you "build" a Scroll site, you are simply generating
 the `index.html` and `article*.html` files in the site's folder.

paragraph
 The suggested project layout above let's you easily
 separate drafts from published content and put all
 under version control.

paragraph 
 With Scroll your site's public static files, generated html,
 and published article source Scroll files, are all in the
 public folder and checked into version control.
 
title4 How do I save drafts?

paragraph
 Save them outside your public folder like in the sample project
 folder above.

title4 What File Formats does Scroll use?

paragraph
 Scroll articles are written as Scroll files with the file
 extension `scroll`. The grammar for Scroll is fully defined
 <a href="https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll/blob/master/scroll.grammar">here</a>
 
paragraph
 Entire Scrolls are saved as <a href="https://github.com/treenotation/jtree/blob/master/langs/stamp/readme.md">
 stamp</a> files with the extension `stamp`.

title4 What languages is Scroll written in?

paragraph
 The Scroll app is written in plain Javascript and
 runs in Node.js.

paragraph
 Scroll makes heavy use of Tree Languages. The CSS is
 written in <a href="https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20hakon">Hakon</a>.
 The HTML is written in <a href="https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20stump"> stump</a>.

paragraph 
 TypeScript may be used in the future but Scroll may
 never get over 1kloc so that might not be necessary.

title4 How does versioning of articles work?

paragraph
 Scroll is designed for git. A single article is stored as
 a single file tracked by git.

title4 Why is Scroll a single page?

paragraph
 Being able to scan the page like a newspaper is a
 very fast reading experience. This is central to Scroll.

paragraph
 Additionally, making it easy to take the content with
 you, and transform it to better suit the reader, is
 also key to Scroll.

paragraph
 Because Scroll is designed for public domain sites,
 we can optimize for the single page reading experience
 but people can have the full Scroll contents and render
 it however best suits them.

title4 Will you make design decisions for non-public domain sites?

paragraph
 No.

title4 Can I use Scroll for internal private sites not intended for publishing?

paragraph
 Yes!

title4 Will you support publishing snippets?

paragraph
 No. But will support making it easier for someone to do that in a fork
 or via plugins.

title4 Will you support newest articles flowing right to left instead of having potentially older articles up top?

paragraph
 No. But will support making it easier for someone to do that in a fork
 or via plugins.

title4 What were some alternatives considered?

paragraph
 There was no publishing software that reads and writes Scroll yet
 so building Scroll was necessary. Jekyll and Brecksblog are 2 biggest
 inspirations.
