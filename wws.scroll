# What is the World Wide Scroll (WWS)?
The WWS is like the World Wide Web, except:
- *Offline.* You download entire sites and browse completely offline locally, rather than fetching one page at a time.
- *Pristine.* No ads, no paywalls, no trackers, no cookies, no copyright.
- *Human.* Instead of domains the WWS has folders owned by humans, not AIs or corporations.
- *Trustworthy.* Source code behind every page.
- *Intelligent.* Built from the ground up in a simple, expandable language.

The World Wide Scroll beta is live!

You can now register your own folder in the World Wide Scroll for $10 per year.

import stripeBuyButton.scroll

# Fine Print
- A purchase entitles you to choose one unique unclaimed alpha-numeric id in the World Wide Scroll for one year, and to make updates to the properties of that folder, as defined in this file.
- All updates are subject to approval by the World Wide Scroll editors.
- WWS Folders can only be reserved by individuals.
 // not corporations
- The WWS is for high quality, non-anonymous content.
 - You must use your real name and a real email address when registering a folder.
  - This information will be publicly visible in this file (`wws.scroll`).
- You can pay for multiple years.
- Limit 5 folders per person.
 - The WWS discourages name squatting and content not edited by humans.
 - If you maintain high quality folders and hit the limit, you can request a higher limit.
- Changes to your folder information may be communicated to the WWS team via email and/or using future self-service software.
