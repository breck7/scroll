title Scroll Release Notes

paragraph
 Here's a list of the notable changes in Scroll.

section 31.4.1 9-3-2022
list
 - 🏥 and that is why you always run the tests.

section 31.4.0 9-3-2022
list
 - 🎉 New keywords: `*`, `footnote`, and `readingList`

* This is a _thought_. It's like a condensed form of aftertext with *bold* and _italics_ and `code` turned on by default.
 footnote default
  And it supports footnotes!

* Projects I'm very actively working on:

section 31.3.0 9-3-2022
list
 - 🏥 Fixed bad regression where only the first word of a replacement line was getting replaced. Sloppy breck, real sloppy.

section 31.2.0 9-2-2022
list
 - 🎉 added `openGraphImage` node

section 31.1.0 9-1-2022
list
 - 🎉 `replace` now supports multiline strings
 - 🏥 fixed broken links bug if using keyboard nav without groups

section 31.0.0 8-31-2022
list
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: upgraded to jtree 56. This is not likely to break anyone. However, if you are extending Scroll with your own nodeTypes you will need to make sure that your abstract nodes (and *only* your abstract nodes) have an id that begins with `abstract`. You can then remove all occurrences of the keyword `abstract` from your grammar node definitions.

section 30.1.1 8-30-2022
list
 - 🎉 Improve header message thanks to dg's feedback

section 30.1.0 8-29-2022
list

section 30.0.0 8-29-2022
list
 - 🎉 Perf: ~2x as fast as v29
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: If using `getFullyExpandedFile(str)` replace with `getFullyExpandedFile(str).code`
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: If using any ScrollFile programatically, a few undocumented getters may have changed.

section 29.0.0 8-28-2022
list
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: if using programatically instead of ScrollPage use ScrollFile

section 28.3.2 8-27-2022
list

section 28.1.0 8-26-2022

section 28.0.0 8-26-2022
paragraph
 This is a *major* update that radically simplifies Scroll and adds significant new capabilities.

subsection From 3 file types to 1

paragraph
 `scroll.settings` and `*.grammar` files are gone. Everything is now done with `.scroll` files, and
 now every keyword is documented and usable on try.scroll.com and type checked.

subsection Imports and variables

paragraph
 Use `import [filepath]` to import one file into another. Use `replace` and `replaceDefault` for variables.

subsection Add your own Grammar extensions directly in your Scroll files

paragraph
 Define new nodeTypes or create your own aliases on a per file basis. Use the import keyword and build your own collection of common reusable node types for your project(s).

subsection Unlimited Groups and Group Pages

paragraph
 Add files to one or more groups and then customize how each group page prints. No more magic or implicit creation of collection pages.

subsection Multiple Compiler Passes

paragraph
 The new language features (imports, grammar nodes, and variables) required a change from a 1 one stage compilation process to a multi-stage compiler pass pattern. The compilers passes run in this order: imports, grammar extensions, then variables. So variables cannot be used in imports or grammar extensions.

subsection Change list

list
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: The `git` setting is renamed to `viewSourceBaseUrl`
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: The `sourceLink` setting is renamed to `viewSourceUrl`
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `skipIndexPage`. Instead you now opt-in to group pages like this: `groups index.html`
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `scroll.settings` concept. Use `import settings.scroll` now.
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: `footer` is now `scrollFooter` and `header` is now `scrollHeader`
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `ignoreGrammarFiles`. Custom grammar extensions must now be explicitly imported and/or be in `.scroll` files.
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: changed link text from "Article source" to "View source"
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: `css` setting is now `scrollCss`
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: DefaultScrollScriptCompiler is now DefaultScrollCompiler
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: removed buildSinglePages, buildIndexPage, buildSnippetsPage, buildRssFeed, and buildCssFile. Everything done by `buildFiles` now. See 'full.scroll', `index.scroll`, `feed.scroll`, and `style.scroll` in `tests/kitchenSink` for how to implement those in new pattern.
 - ⚠️ BREAKING: in default theme CSS some class names have changed:
      scrollArticleDateComponent => scrollDateComponent
      scrollArticlePageComponent => scrollFilePageComponent
      scrollSingleArticleTitle => scrollFilePageTitle
      scrollIndexPageArticleContainerComponent => scrollGroupPageFileContainerComponent
      scrollArticleSourceLinkComponent => scrollFileViewSourceUrlComponent
      scrollIndexPageComponent => scrollGroupPageComponent

 The 🔗link tag only supports single word links. Like everything with ScrollScript, you have
 a number of options if the conventional design doesn't work for you. Your options are:

list
 1. Link just one word. If you need more, perhaps camelCase or snake_case your words together into one concept.
 2. Repeat the link twice <code>foo 🔗link bar 🔗link</code>
 3. Use &lt;a> tags.
 4. Extend the ScrollScript grammar for your site.

paragraph
 Now you can! Sometimes you just want to publish an independent page without including it
 in the index. To do that, just add <code>skipIndexPage</code>.
