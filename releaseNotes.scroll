title Scroll Release Notes
## A list of what has changed in Scroll releases.

startColumns

# 78.0.1 4/26/2024
- 🏥 style fix: ensure column splits don't separate images from their captions

# 78.0.0 4/25/2024
- 🎉 made tabular data a root level parser in Scroll.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: if you had lines with tabs that currently match the catchall paragraph, you'll need to make those explicit paragraphs to avoid them getting parsed by the tabular data parser. You should be able to find those lines with a regex like this: `^(\t|[^ ]+\t)`

Spreadsheets are great tools for working with tabular data. I want to copy/paste between Scroll docs and spreadsheets. This makes it easier.

Tabular data is better than line orientation for experimental data because it requires half the number of tokens and it's more efficient eye movement during comparisons and proofreading.

Scroll already supported tabular data using `tabTable`, but that made copy/paste workflows between spreadsheets and text editors a pain. This should be more ergonomic and make it easier to work with this useful tool of thought.

# 77.3.1 4/23/2024
- 🏥 style fix: fixed style bug where on narrow screens the post title would overlap the corner nav buttons.

# 77.3.0 4/22/2024

 link blog/datasets.html Scroll Datasets

- ⚠️ BREAKING: if you had lines starting with a word then colon, that used the catchall paragraph, such as `Sidenote: yada yada.`, those will now be parsed incorrectly as measures. Just explicitly make them paragraphs `* Sidenote: yada yada.`. This regex can help you find any instances: `^[^ ]+: .`

# 76.0.0 4/19/2024
- 🎨 try using "rem" in CSS to better support the "zooming out" effect on a blog

The code below added to a page will create the zoom out effect:

 class dropcap
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial dropcaps on Wikipedia

# 72.3.0 6/13/2023
- 🎉 if you want to disable `wrapsOn` you can now provide parameters to specify only the wraps you want, if any.
- 🏥 by default katex wraps won't run unless there is a `katex` node in a file. So any paragraph containing multiple $ will now behave as before katex wraps were added.

- 🎉 added `wideColumns` keyword

# 72.1.0 5/26/2023

 - A single # is now h1, ## is h2, et cetera. `title` can be thought of as `h0`.

# 70.0.0 4/29/2023
- 🎉 Paragraphs no longer need to start with '* '. All non-blank lines that don't start with a defined keyword are now treated as a paragraph. The catch-all is no longer an error. It is recommended to start all paragraphs with a capital letter, as in the future it may become the standard that keywords start with a lowercase or symbol, and you will avoid any future keyword collisions.
 - Thanks to zoeartemis for the feedback.
 - No changes are needed but you can update your files with the find/replace combo: `\n\* ` `\n`.
  - You may want to use the case sensitive `\n\* [a-z]` search first to find any paragraphs that start with a lowercase letter.
  - You also want to be careful of any lines that would now start with `&lt;!`, as they will be parsed as HTML nodes.

# 69.3.0 4/26/2023

- 🏥 cache hotfix for embedded snippets.

# 63.0.0 3/27/2023
This was a big internal refactor to remove the outdated concept of `ScrollFolder` and rely on the file system parameter instead. This makes it easier to build webapps serving dynamic Scroll pages. It also simplifies the upcoming isomorphic release.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: Only users using Scroll as a module may be affected:
 - Removed `ScrollFolder`. Exports now include `ScrollDiskFileSystem` and `ScrollInMemoryFileSystem`. To get the same behavior as `new ScrollFolder("folder").buildFiles()` use `new ScrollDiskFileSystem().buildFilesInFolder("folder")`.

---

# 59.5.0 3/9/2023

- ⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected). If you had put markup directives in your title tags, such as *bolds*, those will now actually be evaluated.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: `title` blocks now start a section like `#` and `##`, so you may need to add an empty line to end the section, for example if you previously had a `startColumns` right after the title tag.

# 56.1.0 2/8/2023
- 🎉 `snippets` nodes can now accept multiple groups and also groups can be in different folders. Syntax is `[folderPath]/[groupName]` For example:

You can add the following code to the page(s) you are working on to have them reload without manually refreshing the browser:

scrollCode
 html <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1;">

# 54.1.0 1/19/2023
- 🏥 `scroll init` no longer starts with a `viewSourceBaseUrl`. If not provided then the View Source link is to the scroll file, so new sites don't start with broken links.

# 54.0.0 1/19/2023
- 🎉 `link` nodes can now have `target`. This link will open in blank tab.
 https://scroll.pub This link
  target _blank

- ⚠️ BREAKING: `note` keyword under `link` nodes has been renamed to `title` and instead of it being a block just the line is used. This is to better reflect what it does. See example above.

# 53.0.2 1/18/2023

- 🏥 fix: a `*` node with just a link now works correctly. Previously was rendering blank.

# 52.2.0 1/13/2023

# 52.1.1 1/12/2023

# 52.1.0 1/12/2023
- 🏥 Upgrade JTree.

# 52.0.0 1/10/2023
- 🎉 API usage: new getter `buildNeeded` returns whether the folder needs to be rebuilt. You can use this to skip unnecessary builds for faster perf.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: This should not break anyone however behavior has changed. `scroll build` now does not overwrite unmodified files. Now `mtime` reflects when the generated HTML last changed instead of when the `scroll build` command was last run. This speeds up `rsync` deploys.

# 51.0.0 1/9/2023
- 🎉 This version introduces the concept of `Sections`. Headers (`#`, `##` and `?`) now start a section, and a blank line ends it. A section will not be split across columns.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: This slightly changes layouts (for the better, hopefully in all cases) so do a manual inspection of output.

# 50.2.0 1/5/2023

- 🎉 made footnotes compile faster
- ⚠️ BREAKING: simplified footnotes by removing `notes` keyword. Referencing a footnote is done the same way but now footnotes just print immediately like you'd expect.

- 🎉 you can now specify number of max columns in `startColumns` keyword
- 🏥 fixed body padding regression

# 47.0.0 11/28/2022
This is a major breaking refactor. Scroll now generates flat html. This release is NOT recommended for the feint of heart. Wait a day or two until the bugs are ironed out. 

- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed automatic meta tag generation. You now need to explicitly add a `metaTags` keyword.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `<!doctype>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. Unnecessary. Modern browsers don't need them. HTML never should have had head/body split.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `SCROLL_CSS` export.

- 🏥 `stump` keyword works now

# 46.1.0 11/27/2022
- 🏥 `scrollCss` works now

# 46.0.0 11/27/2022
This is a major breaking refactor. *All the implicit imports are gone*. Everything must be explicitly included now (perhaps with a few slight exceptions like meta tags). This migration guide is a work in progress. This release is NOT recommended for the feint of heart. Wait a day or two until the bugs are ironed out.

- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `maxColumns` and `columnWidth` and `template`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: headers and footers are not provided by default. You now must explicitly include them with `scrollHeader` and `scrollFooter`. The previous behavior of `scrollHeader` and `scrollFooter` has been removed.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: columns are not provided by default. You now need to wrap your content in `startColumns` and `endColumns`.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: CSS is not included by default. You need to use the snippet keyword `scrollCssTag`. The previous behavior of `scrollCss` has been removed. Also `printScrollCss` is now `scrollCss`.

This is the `title` simplification refactor release.
- 🎉 new: `description` keyword for use in open graph description generation.

- ⚠️ BREAKING: Group pages no longer have a `title` in their HTML by default. Must set manually.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: Removed `siteTitle` and `siteDescription` keywords. Those concepts no longer make sense after the introduction of `groups` concept. Generally if you rename `siteTitle` to `title` and `siteDescription` to `description` it should work well.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: Removed `htmlTitle` keyword.

The goal of this release is to simplify and speed up Scroll by removing legacy features.
This is a major release that removes a bunch of the original keywords in favor of the newer more advanced aftertext nodes.
If you don't want to upgrade at this time, it's very easy to just add the removed grammar definitions from this commit into your existing scrolls using the normal extension pattern.
You can also easily alias the newer aftertext node types with the original keywords above if you'd prefer.

# 28.0.0 2022.8.26
This is a *major* update that radically simplifies Scroll and adds significant new capabilities.

## From 3 file types to 1

`scroll.settings` and `*.grammar` files are gone. Everything is now done with `.scroll` files, and now every keyword is documented and usable on try.scroll.com and type checked.

## Imports and variables

Use `import [filepath]` to import one file into another. Use `replace` and `replaceDefault` for variables.

## Add your own Grammar extensions directly in your Scroll files

Define new nodeTypes or create your own aliases on a per file basis. Use the import keyword and build your own collection of common reusable node types for your project(s).

## Unlimited Groups and Group Pages

Add files to one or more groups and then customize how each group page prints. No more magic or implicit creation of collection pages.

## Multiple Compiler Passes

The new language features (imports, grammar nodes, and variables) required a change from a 1 one stage compilation process to a multi-stage compiler pass pattern. The compilers passes run in this order: imports, grammar extensions, then variables. So variables cannot be used in imports or grammar extensions.

## Change list

- ⚠️ BREAKING: The `git` setting is renamed to `viewSourceBaseUrl`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: The `sourceLink` setting is renamed to `viewSourceUrl`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `skipIndexPage`. Instead you now opt-in to group pages like this: `groups index.html`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `scroll.settings` concept. Use `import settings.scroll` now.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: `footer` is now `scrollFooter` and `header` is now `scrollHeader`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `ignoreGrammarFiles`. Custom grammar extensions must now be explicitly imported and/or be in `.scroll` files.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: changed link text from "Article source" to "View source"
- ⚠️ BREAKING: `css` setting is now `scrollCss`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: DefaultScrollScriptCompiler is now DefaultScrollCompiler
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed buildSinglePages, buildIndexPage, buildSnippetsPage, buildRssFeed, and buildCssFile. Everything done by `buildFiles` now. See 'full.scroll', `index.scroll`, `feed.scroll`, and `style.scroll` in `tests/kitchenSink` for how to implement those in new pattern.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: in default theme CSS some class names have changed:

code
 scrollArticleDateComponent => scrollDateComponent
 scrollArticlePageComponent => scrollFilePageComponent
 scrollSingleArticleTitle => scrollFilePageTitle
 scrollIndexPageArticleContainerComponent => scrollGroupPageFileContainerComponent
 scrollArticleSourceLinkComponent => scrollFileViewSourceUrlComponent
 scrollIndexPageComponent => scrollGroupPageComponent
 scrollIndexPageFileContainerComponent => scrollGroupPageFileContainerComponent

- ⚠️ just calling ScrollScript Scroll again unless it becomes confusing

# 13.0.0 2021.05.17

- 🎉 skipIndexPage nodeType

? How do I use the new single word links?

For single word links in paragraph nodes only (for now) you can now do:

code
 paragraph
  This is a link🔗example.com

Below is a regex for migrating existing <code>*.scroll</code> files.

code
 <a href="https://([^"]+)">([^ ]+)</a>
 $2🔗$1

? How do I use the 🔗link tag with multiword links?

The 🔗link tag only supports single word links. Like everything with ScrollScript, you have a number of options if the conventional design doesn't work for you. Your options are:

- 1. Link just one word. If you need more, perhaps camelCase or snake_case your words together into one concept.
- 2. Repeat the link twice <code>foo 🔗link bar 🔗link</code>
- 3. Use &lt;a> tags.
- 4. Extend the ScrollScript grammar for your site.

? Can I not include a page in the index page?
Now you can! Sometimes you just want to publish an independent page without including it in the index. To do that, just add `skipIndexPage`.
