- 🎉 Documentation improvement

- ⚠️ BREAKING: Removed the original `aftertext` node in favor of `*` nodes. Regex [search replace] to upgrade: `^aftertext\n ` `* `

* If you don't want to upgrade at this time, it's very easy to just add the removed grammar definitions from this commit into your existing scrolls using the normal extension pattern.
* You can also easily alias the newer aftertext node types with the original keywords above if you'd prefer.

# 31.3.0 9-3-2022
- 🏥 Fixed bad regression where only the first word of a replacement line was getting replaced.

# 31.2.0 9-2-2022
- 🎉 added `openGraphImage` node

- 🎉 `replace` now supports multiline strings
- 🏥 fixed broken links bug if using keyboard nav without groups

# 31.0.0 8-31-2022
- ⚠️ BREAKING: upgraded to jtree 56. This is not likely to break anyone. However, if you are extending Scroll with your own nodeTypes you will need to make sure that your abstract nodes (and *only* your abstract nodes) have an id that begins with `abstract`. You can then remove all occurrences of the keyword `abstract` from your grammar node definitions.

# 30.1.1 8-30-2022
- 🎉 Improve header message thanks to dg's feedback

# 30.1.0 8-29-2022

# 28.3.1 8-27-2022
- 🏥 fixed minor grammar typo and added test

# 28.2.0 8-26-2022
- 🏥 export getFullyExpandedFile

# 28.1.0 8-26-2022
- 🏥 imports can now be recursive

# 28.0.0 8-26-2022
* This is a *major* update that radically simplifies Scroll and adds significant new capabilities.

## From 3 file types to 1

* `scroll.settings` and `*.grammar` files are gone. Everything is now done with `.scroll` files, and
 now every keyword is documented and usable on try.scroll.com and type checked.

## Imports and variables

* Use `import [filepath]` to import one file into another. Use `replace` and `replaceDefault` for variables.

## Add your own Grammar extensions directly in your Scroll files

* Define new nodeTypes or create your own aliases on a per file basis. Use the import keyword and build your own collection of common reusable node types for your project(s).

## Unlimited Groups and Group Pages

* Add files to one or more groups and then customize how each group page prints. No more magic or implicit creation of collection pages.

## Multiple Compiler Passes

* The new language features (imports, grammar nodes, and variables) required a change from a 1 one stage compilation process to a multi-stage compiler pass pattern. The compilers passes run in this order: imports, grammar extensions, then variables. So variables cannot be used in imports or grammar extensions.

## Change list

- ⚠️ BREAKING: The `git` setting is renamed to `viewSourceBaseUrl`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: The `sourceLink` setting is renamed to `viewSourceUrl`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `skipIndexPage`. Instead you now opt-in to group pages like this: `groups index.html`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `scroll.settings` concept. Use `import settings.scroll` now.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: `footer` is now `scrollFooter` and `header` is now `scrollHeader`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `ignoreGrammarFiles`. Custom grammar extensions must now be explicitly imported and/or be in `.scroll` files.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: changed link text from "Article source" to "View source"
- ⚠️ BREAKING: `css` setting is now `scrollCss`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: DefaultScrollScriptCompiler is now DefaultScrollCompiler
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed buildSinglePages, buildIndexPage, buildSnippetsPage, buildRssFeed, and buildCssFile. Everything done by `buildFiles` now. See 'full.scroll', `index.scroll`, `feed.scroll`, and `style.scroll` in `tests/kitchenSink` for how to implement those in new pattern.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: in default theme CSS some class names have changed:
      scrollArticleDateComponent => scrollDateComponent
      scrollArticlePageComponent => scrollFilePageComponent
      scrollSingleArticleTitle => scrollFilePageTitle
      scrollIndexPageArticleContainerComponent => scrollGroupPageFileContainerComponent
      scrollArticleSourceLinkComponent => scrollFileViewSourceUrlComponent
      scrollIndexPageComponent => scrollGroupPageComponent
      scrollIndexPageFileContainerComponent => scrollGroupPageFileContainerComponent

code
 paragraph
  This is a link🔗example.com

* Below is a regex for migrating existing <code>*.scroll</code> files.

code
 <a href="https://([^"]+)">([^ ]+)</a>
 $2🔗$1

? How do I use the 🔗link tag with multiword links?

* The 🔗link tag only supports single word links. Like everything with ScrollScript, you have
 a number of options if the conventional design doesn't work for you. Your options are:

- 1. Link just one word. If you need more, perhaps camelCase or snake_case your words together into one concept.
- 2. Repeat the link twice <code>foo 🔗link bar 🔗link</code>
- 3. Use &lt;a> tags.
- 4. Extend the ScrollScript grammar for your site.

? Can I not include a page in the index page?

* Now you can! Sometimes you just want to publish an independent page without including it
 in the index. To do that, just add <code>skipIndexPage</code>.
