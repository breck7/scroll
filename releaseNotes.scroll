startColumns

* Here's a list of the notable changes in Scroll.

# 52.2.0 1/13/2023
- 🎉 `html` now also supports quick oneliners:

belowAsCode
html <b>here is some html</b>

# 52.1.1 1/12/2023
- 🏥 fix: getGroup was including files marked with `importOnly`

# 52.1.0 1/12/2023
- 🏥 Upgrade JTree.

# 52.0.0 1/10/2023
- 🎉 API usage: new getter `buildNeeded` returns whether the folder needs to be rebuilt. You can use this to skip unnecessary builds for faster perf.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: This should not break anyone however behavior has changed. `scroll build` now does not overwrite unmodified files. Now `mtime` reflects when the generated HTML last changed instead of when the `scroll build` command was last run. This speeds up `rsync` deploys.

# 51.0.0 1/9/2023
* 🎉 This version introduces the concept of `Sections`. Headers (`#`, `##` and `?`) now start a section, and a blank line ends it. A section will not be split across columns.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: This slightly changes layouts (for the better, hopefully in all cases) so do a manual inspection of output.

# 50.2.0 1/5/2023
- 🏥 fix bug where it was trying to get image dimensions of remote images when building
- 🎉 upgrade jtree to get perf improvements

# 50.1.0 1/5/2023
- 🎉 `listCommand` now much faster (~33% in pldb) because `findScrollsInDirRecursive` will now skip `node_modules` folders entirely.

# 50.0.0 1/4/2023
- 🎉 made footnotes compile faster
- ⚠️ BREAKING: simplified footnotes by removing `notes` keyword. Referencing a footnote is done the same way but now footnotes just print immediately like you'd expect.

* For example^exampleFootnote

^exampleFootnote This is an example footnote.

- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `startRuledColumns` which doesn't appear to be used anywhere
- 🏥 general code cleanup and refactor by splitting big grammar files into separate files.

# 48.3.0 1/2/2023
- 🎉 added `youTube` keyword for embedding youTube videos with proper responsive sizing.

# 48.2.0 1/2/2023
- 🎉 simplify default theme by removing ornamental borders

# 48.1.0 1/2/2023

# 48.0.0 1/1/2023
* This release simplifies and removes things from the default install.

- ⚠️ BREAKING: the `github` keyword is now `git` to make it clearer what it does. The git SVG is now used in the default theme.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `twitter` keyword and removed the Twitter link from default theme.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: `SVGS` is no longer exported.
- 🎉 Minor style fix of header and switched email SVG with a nice svg from http://laurareen.com

# 47.4.0 12/30/2022
- 🎉 rss 2.0 now generated with `printFeed`, meaning pubDate and lastBuildDate are included.

# 47.3.0 12/29/2022
- 🎉 upstreamed `stumpNoSnippet` for advanced use case of PLDB until we have better support for custom grammars when using as a library.

# 47.2.1 12/29/2022
- 🏥 endColumns nodes should not be printed in snippets

# 47.2.0 12/29/2022
- 🎉 added `doNotPrint` class to header and footer elements for better printability.

# 47.1.2 12/05/2022

# 47.1.1 11/30/2022
- 🏥 init fixes

- 🎉 you can now specify number of max columns in `startColumns` keyword
- 🏥 fixed body padding regression

# 47.0.0 11/28/2022
* This is a major breaking refactor. Scroll now generates flat html. This release is NOT recommended for the feint of heart. Wait a day or two until the bugs are ironed out. 

- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed automatic meta tag generation. You now need to explicitly add a `metaTags` keyword.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `<!doctype>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. Unnecessary. Modern browsers don't need them. HTML never should have had head/body split.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `SCROLL_CSS` export.

# 46.2.0 11/27/2022
- 🏥 `stump` keyword works now

# 46.1.0 11/27/2022
- 🏥 `scrollCss` works now

# 46.0.0 11/27/2022
* This is a major breaking refactor. *All the implicit imports are gone*. Everything must be explicitly included now (perhaps with a few slight exceptions like meta tags). This migration guide is a work in progress. This release is NOT recommended for the feint of heart. Wait a day or two until the bugs are ironed out.

- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `maxColumns` and `columnWidth` and `template`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: headers and footers are not provided by default. You now must explicitly include them with `scrollHeader` and `scrollFooter`. The previous behavior of `scrollHeader` and `scrollFooter` has been removed.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: columns are not provided by default. You now need to wrap your content in `startColumns` and `endColumns`.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: CSS is not included by default. You need to use the snippet keyword `scrollCssTag`. The previous behavior of `scrollCss` has been removed. Also `printScrollCss` is now `scrollCss`.

# 45.0.0 11/24/2022
- 🎉 a whole new way to do footnotes/end notes.

- ⚠️ BREAKING: Group pages no longer have a `title` in their HTML by default. Must set manually.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: Removed `siteTitle` and `siteDescription` keywords. Those concepts no longer make sense after the introduction of `groups` concept. Generally if you rename `siteTitle` to `title` and `siteDescription` to `description` it should work well.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: Removed `htmlTitle` keyword.

# 43.1.1 2022.11.22
- 🏥 fix aftertext bug where `http` quick links were not matching.

# 43.1.0 2022.11.14

# 43.0.0 2022.11.12
- 🎉 New: Linkify! Links like https://breckyunits.com and email addresses like feedback@scroll.pub are now compiled to HTML `a` tags automatically. Note: if an `a` tag is detected in the node Linkify will be DISABLED for that node.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) slim chance linkify may insert links where you previously did not want them.

# 42.0.0 2022.11.09
- ⚠️ BREAKING: `scroll check` is now `scroll test`

# 41.0.0 2022.11.08

# 40.0.0 2022.11.05
- ⚠️ BREAKING: (no one should be affected) `caption` now extends the thought (`*`) node.

image public/screenshot.png
 caption You can now use all aftertext directives like *bold* in caption nodes. Note: in the future we may just remove the keyword `caption` and you can just use `*` directly.

# 39.0.0 2022.11.03
- ⚠️ BREAKING: `scroll init` no longer creates a `feed.xml` file by default. You can easily add an XML feed manually with the 2 steps below:

 printFeed index

code
 comment Add the line below to your posts and/or settings import file.

# 37.1.0 2022.10.28
- 🎉 Documentation improvement

# 37.0.0 2022.10.28

- ⚠️ BREAKING: Removed basic `paragraph` node. Regex [search replace] to upgrade: `^paragraph\n ` `* `
- ⚠️ BREAKING: Removed basic `question` node. Regex [search replace] to upgrade: `^question ` `? `

- ⚠️ BREAKING: Removed basic `unorderedList` node.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: Removed support for 🔗 links. Regex [search replace] to upgrade: ` ([^ ]+)🔗([^ ]+)` ` <a href="https://$2">$1</a>`

* The goal of this release is to simplify and speed up Scroll by removing legacy features.
* This is a major release that removes a bunch of the original keywords in favor of the newer more advanced aftertext nodes.
* If you don't want to upgrade at this time, it's very easy to just add the removed grammar definitions from this commit into your existing scrolls using the normal extension pattern.
* You can also easily alias the newer aftertext node types with the original keywords above if you'd prefer.

- 🎉 `replace` now supports multiline strings
- 🏥 fixed broken links bug if using keyboard nav without groups

# 31.0.0 2022.8.31
- ⚠️ BREAKING: upgraded to jtree 56. This is not likely to break anyone. However, if you are extending Scroll with your own nodeTypes you will need to make sure that your abstract nodes (and *only* your abstract nodes) have an id that begins with `abstract`. You can then remove all occurrences of the keyword `abstract` from your grammar node definitions.

# 30.1.1 2022.8.30
- 🎉 Improve header message thanks to dg's feedback

# 30.1.0 2022.8.29

- 🏥 imports can now be recursive

# 28.0.0 2022.8.26
* This is a *major* update that radically simplifies Scroll and adds significant new capabilities.

## From 3 file types to 1

* `scroll.settings` and `*.grammar` files are gone. Everything is now done with `.scroll` files, and
 now every keyword is documented and usable on try.scroll.com and type checked.

## Imports and variables

* Use `import [filepath]` to import one file into another. Use `replace` and `replaceDefault` for variables.

## Add your own Grammar extensions directly in your Scroll files

* Define new nodeTypes or create your own aliases on a per file basis. Use the import keyword and build your own collection of common reusable node types for your project(s).

## Unlimited Groups and Group Pages

* Add files to one or more groups and then customize how each group page prints. No more magic or implicit creation of collection pages.

## Multiple Compiler Passes

* The new language features (imports, grammar nodes, and variables) required a change from a 1 one stage compilation process to a multi-stage compiler pass pattern. The compilers passes run in this order: imports, grammar extensions, then variables. So variables cannot be used in imports or grammar extensions.

## Change list

- ⚠️ BREAKING: The `git` setting is renamed to `viewSourceBaseUrl`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: The `sourceLink` setting is renamed to `viewSourceUrl`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `skipIndexPage`. Instead you now opt-in to group pages like this: `groups index.html`

- ⚠️ BREAKING: `footer` is now `scrollFooter` and `header` is now `scrollHeader`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed `ignoreGrammarFiles`. Custom grammar extensions must now be explicitly imported and/or be in `.scroll` files.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: changed link text from "Article source" to "View source"
- ⚠️ BREAKING: `css` setting is now `scrollCss`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: DefaultScrollScriptCompiler is now DefaultScrollCompiler
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed buildSinglePages, buildIndexPage, buildSnippetsPage, buildRssFeed, and buildCssFile. Everything done by `buildFiles` now. See 'full.scroll', `index.scroll`, `feed.scroll`, and `style.scroll` in `tests/kitchenSink` for how to implement those in new pattern.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: in default theme CSS some class names have changed:
      scrollArticleDateComponent => scrollDateComponent
      scrollArticlePageComponent => scrollFilePageComponent
      scrollSingleArticleTitle => scrollFilePageTitle
      scrollIndexPageArticleContainerComponent => scrollGroupPageFileContainerComponent
      scrollArticleSourceLinkComponent => scrollFileViewSourceUrlComponent
      scrollIndexPageComponent => scrollGroupPageComponent
      scrollIndexPageFileContainerComponent => scrollGroupPageFileContainerComponent

? Why the new `question` nodes?

* Question and answer structures are literally older than the Socratic Method. Such a common semantic pattern deserves it's own keywords.

? How do I migrate from title# nodes?

* The below regex may help.

code
 Find ^title\d (.+\?)
  ReplaceWith question $1
 Find ^title\d (.+)
  ReplaceWith section $1

code
 paragraph
  This is a link🔗example.com

* Below is a regex for migrating existing <code>*.scroll</code> files.

code
 <a href="https://([^"]+)">([^ ]+)</a>
 $2🔗$1

? How do I use the 🔗link tag with multiword links?

* The 🔗link tag only supports single word links. Like everything with ScrollScript, you have
 a number of options if the conventional design doesn't work for you. Your options are:

- 1. Link just one word. If you need more, perhaps camelCase or snake_case your words together into one concept.
- 2. Repeat the link twice <code>foo 🔗link bar 🔗link</code>
- 3. Use &lt;a> tags.
- 4. Extend the ScrollScript grammar for your site.

? Can I not include a page in the index page?

* Now you can! Sometimes you just want to publish an independent page without including it
 in the index. To do that, just add <code>skipIndexPage</code>.
