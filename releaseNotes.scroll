question How do I use the 🔗link tag with multiword links?

paragraph
 The 🔗link tag only supports single word links. Like everything with Scrolldown, you have
 a number of options if the conventional design doesn't work for you. Your options are:

list
 1. Link just one word. If you need more, perhaps camelCase or snake_case your words together into one concept.
 2. Repeat the link twice <code>foo 🔗link bar 🔗link</code>
 3. Use &lt;a> tags.
 4. Extend the Scrolldown grammar for your site.

question Can I not include a page in the index page?

paragraph
 Now you can! Sometimes you just want to publish an independent page without including it
 in the index. To do that, just add <code>skipIndexPage</code>.
