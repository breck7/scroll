 The 🔗link tag only supports single word links. Like everything with Scrolldown, you have
 a number of options if the conventional design doesn't work for you. Your options are:

list
 1. Link just one word. If you need more, perhaps camelCase or snake_case your words together into one concept.
 2. Repeat the link twice <code>foo 🔗link bar 🔗link</code>
 3. Use &lt;a> tags.
 4. Extend the Scrolldown grammar for your site.

paragraph
 Now you can! Sometimes you just want to publish an independent page without including it
 in the index. To do that, just add <code>skipIndexPage</code>.
