<td>Contacts: A Microlang for Managing Contacts =========================================== by Breck Yunits  https://twitter.com/breckyunits Breck Yunits  July 16, 2024  Imagine a single plain text file named `contacts.scroll` where you stored the contact info for your family, friends, and colleagues, and you could track changes with git, compile it to a beautiful PDF or HTML page with search and sort, and it would also compile to CSV and/or JSON for import into iPhone, Android, Gmail, Outlook, et cetera?  Also imagine that this tool is free, open source, and public domain.  ***  Introducing *Contacts*, a microlanguage (currently 23 lines of code, including comments) that makes it as concise as possible to add, prune, display, print and export your contacts.  https://github.com/breck7/scroll/blob/main/microlangs/contacts.parsers 23 lines of code  ***  There's almost nothing to learn (the code is self-explanatory).  In fact, it's almost guaranteed that using Contacts you will need to write less (we've taken every unnecessary character out).  ***  Example =======  👤 Jack Doe phone +1 (555) 123-4567 email john.doe@example.com birthday 2/23/84 notes Daughter - Samantha.  👤 Jill Smith phone +1 (555) 123-4562 email jill@gmail.com birthday 1/23/80  ***  How to use ==========  1. Create a file named something like `contacts.scroll` with this content: // You can import the file, or just copy/paste the 21 lines of code here. import [pathToScroll]/microlangs/contacts.parser title My Contacts buildConcepts contacts.csv contacts.json contacts.tsv buildHtml gazetteCss mediumColumns 1 printTitle printConcepts tableSearch  👤 Jack Doe phone +1 (555) 123-4567 email john.doe@example.com birthday 2/23/84 notes Daughter - Samantha.  👤 Jill Smith phone +1 (555) 123-4562 email jill@gmail.com birthday 1/23/80  2. Run `scroll build`  Done! You should now see a contacts.html file for display and printing as well as TSV, CSV, and JSON files.  https://scroll.pub/blog/../tests/kitchenSink/contacts.html contacts.html  ***  [Image Omitted]  Contacts is interoperable with pen and paper.  ***  What do you think? Anything that should be added/removed/improved?  ***  Notes ===== 1. The idea for Contacts was sparked by this tweet from Tyler Tringas.  https://x.com/tylertringas/status/1813239718957461528 this tweet from Tyler Tringas  **** </td>

<td>How I Designed Helpful 404's and Stopped Worrying about Broken Links ==================================================================== by Breck Yunits  https://breckyunits.com Breck Yunits  July 12, 2024  _Woohoo!_  Your blog is on top of Reddit!  _OH NO._  There's a typo in your url. 🤦  *What do you do?*  ***  You try to calm yourself down.  _Almost no one looks at the url and the content of the article is what's important and the traffic is coming_  But then you think _all I can see is that i before e after c!_  But then you think _is that *really* a rule_ and _maybe that's how it's spelled in London?_  ***  You can't help yourself.  It's an affront to your craftsmanship to not correct the bad filename.  You know you can so easily rename the file but then existing links will break and so you'll have to add redirects but that means more files to maintain or god forbid that would require adding a server and you just love your static blog and it's almost 2pm and you have to leave and pick up the kids from school what do you do!?!!  Or do you just break the links and going forward everyone will have the proper URL but everyone who clicks the old links will see an unhelpful 404 and you reflect on how great this thing that Tim Berners-Lee gave to the world is and how could you litter his creation with unhelpful 404s?  ***  If the story above resonates with you, the bad news is you may suffer from Broken Link Phobia. Luckily, there is now a cure.  ***  Introducing: Helpful 404's - never worry about broken links again! ==================================================================  Scroll now comes with a way to generate a very helpful 404 page so your visitors will get redirected to the right place even if the URL they clicked is off by a few characters.  The best part? It works entirely client side on static sites.  How to use ==========  *Step 1* Create a `sitemap.scroll` page like this:  buildTxt sitemap.txt baseUrl https://scroll.pub/ printSiteMap  *Step 2* Create a `404.scroll` page like this: buildHtml Sorry, the url you requested was not found. helpfulNotFound sitemap.txt  That's it! The `helpfulNotFound` parser in Scroll will add Javascript to the 404 page that fetches all the urls found in the sitemap and shows the user the closest match. As a bonus, you also get a `sitemap.txt` file great for Google SEO and other uses.  See it in action here by clicking on this intentionally broken link:  https://scroll.pub/blog/helpful_404s.html intentionally broken link  ***  I've been using Helpful 404s on all my sites for the past couple of months and it's been delightful.  I no longer spend any time worrying about making improvements to URLS.  I just do it and I know that users following old links will still have a good experience.  ***  If you like stuff like Helpful 404's, there's _a lot_ more like that in Scroll, which is public domain and open source.  Try it today, and if you like what we are doing please consider bringing your site to the World Wide Scroll!  https://wws.scroll.pub World Wide Scroll  **** </td>

It handles many of the hard parts of data vis, and it's open source, so we can help them fix the parts that are still a little rough.  https://github.com/observablehq/plot open source  But I found a way to take Plot to the next level: I combined it with Scroll.  https://scroll.pub/blog/../index.html Scroll  The Plot/Scroll integration is early, but I can already tell it will evolve into a _very useful_ data science tool.  ***  A Scatterplot with one word ===========================  You can now make scatterplots with one word.  Simply by writing the word `scatterplot` in a Scroll document, you get a scatterplot.  Obviously you want to add a few more words (2 more to add your own data, unless you are only interested in stock datasets), but I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that this is the simplest way to generate a scatterplot now and forever will be (until the day when we have mind-reading machines that can generate a scatterplot with zero words).  https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/19d1k19/does_anyone_know_of_any_good_titanic_datasets/ stock datasets  But enough talk, let's see some code.

You might call them _deconstructed csvs_ or _deconstructed spreadsheets_.  - Use LLMs to *instantly generate ScrollSets* that are ready for human verification and improvement. - Intermingle structured data with markup to *annotate any and every part of a ScrollSets* while still generating strict tabular files for data analysis tools. - Put data, schema, citations, and documentation *all* in one (or more) plain text file(s) to easily share, collaborate on, and improve, all *tracked by git for trust*. - Add unlimited citations (or none) to *every* measurement.  Quick Code Example: ===================  This ScrollSets has 2 measures (columns) and 2 concepts (rows).  Documentation, column definitions, rows and *any notes/markup/content* can go in the same file.  # Measures (aka Header, aka Columns, aka Schema)  idParser  // Every concept needs an "id" (or other concept delimiter)  extends abstractIdParser moonsParser  extends abstractIntegerParser  # Concepts (aka Rows)  id mars moons 2  // I verified moon count with Google. - BY  id jupiter moons 63  // Note: the moons of Jupiter have their own Wikipedia Page   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Jupiter moons of Jupiter  buildConcepts demo.csv  The code above generates an HTML page and `demo.csv` that contains this: ========================================================================  id,moons mars,2 jupiter,63  Overview: ========= - ScrollSets are built from 4 atomic elements:  - concepts   - think of rows in a spreadsheet   - denoted by a line starting with `id `   - concepts are multiple lines of measurements  - measures   - think of these as the column names in a spreadsheet, along with meta information about the column   - aka "parsers"   - measures are defined in Parsers that start with a line like `moonsParser`  - values   - these are just the values of the measurements  - measurements   - concept & measure & value = measurement   - 1 measurement = 1 line   - measurements can have nested comments that are stripped when compiling to TSV/CSV  How to use ========== - A concept is like a row in a database. All concepts need an id (or other concept delimiter). When you write `id [conceptId]`, Scroll knows that is the beginning of a new concept. - Measure definitions (aka "parsers") must come before the first concept and are written as Parsers, just like any other Scroll Parser. Measure parsers need to extend one of the abstract measure parser classes defined in `measures.scroll`. - Measurements are then done like this `appeared 2024`  FAQ === Isn't the better idea to enhance existing spreadsheet GUIs with LLM generation capabilities? ============================================================================================ Almost certainly. Using ScrollSets will be much slower and worse than future spreadsheet apps with carefully crafted LLM integrations.  However, it's important to also have simple, lower tech, timeless tools and ScrollSets is one of those.  Can't you do this same thing with YAML and/or Markdown? ======================================================= Yes! You can easily achieve the same thing as LLMs & ScrollSets using LLMs & YAML, or LLMs & YAML & Markdown.  https://yaml.org/ YAML  https://github.github.com/gfm/ Markdown  For YAML, just put your documentation and schema in YAML comments up top and then have a tiny script to read that YAML and dump CSV/TSV/JSON or whatever. YAML gives you loads of data structures to use and is widely supported in many languages. But generating HTML from the same file would require more work.  If you want to intermix markup content with your data, you can use Markdown to add the marked up content and then have code sections embedding the YAML and a tiny script to parse out those YAML blocks and write your data to disk.  So, why use Scroll for storing data instead of YAML? ==================================================== Either can do the job. I expect the Scroll design to end up being more ergonomic, but that might not be true or may be unimportant.  If you don't like Scroll's (evolving) version and want to switch it will always be straightforward to automatically refactor to YAML.  What other related work is out there? ===================================== This is a simple pattern to implement, so I'm sure it is likely it has been done a few times before. Please let me know so I can include links to--and learn from--any other prior art.  What are the advanced features? =============================== - Types correctly exported in JSON - Supports nested measures - Support for computed measures - Autojoins across files on ids^roadmap - Auto generates normalized tables for array measures^roadmap - Support for text blobs^roadmap ^roadmap: Planned.  What is the origin of ScrollSets? ================================= LLM dataset generation is a _major_ breakthrough in datasets. ScrollSets are, at best, a minor improvement. They are designed to work alongside LLMs to help solve the Dataset Needed problem.  https://breckyunits.com/dataset-needed.html Dataset Needed  ScrollSets evolved out of TrueBase. ScrollSets have eliminated the need for the TrueBase software (and existing TrueBase sites should be migrated to ScrollSets), but were informed by the TrueBase build experience.  https://truebase.treenotation.org TrueBase  Although ScrollSets are designed for a world with LLMs, the design is meant to be useful without them as well, and would also have been mildly useful 30 years ago.  What were the design goals? =========================== - Have an LLM do the bulk of the work while humans supervise to remove hallucinations. - Can store everything (documentation, schema, all concepts) in 1 clean plain text file or split into many files (using the `import` parser). - The ScrollSet syntax balances _looseness_ useful in creative thinking with the _tightness_ needed by tabular data visualization and analysis tools.  Why are measures and concepts root-level features and not indented? =================================================================== The normal way to implement this in Scroll would be something like: measures  id string  moons int concept  id mars  moons 2 concept  id jupiter  moons 63  The flat design was chosen for ergonomic reasons. ScrollSets seem like they might be useful enough to be worth breaking from Scroll convention a bit. Like all things in Scroll, ScrollSets are an experiment, and maybe this design will evolve.

<td>Introducing Program Links ========================= by Breck Yunits  https://github.com/breck7 Breck Yunits  May 8, 2023  Some web apps are designed to load _entire programs_ from a link. But if a program contain certain characters, such as _newlines_, those links won't work as-is. To create working links you have to run them through `encodeURIComponent`.  If you are creating blog content by hand this is annoying. To update a program link you have to keep a copy of the program, update that, then run `encodeURIComponent`, then paste the result into your post.  Today's release of Scroll includes a small new addition that solves this problem. You can call them "Multline Links" or "Program Links".  ***  Here are two examples =====================  Let's start with a small example. View the source of this page to see the code used to generate the program links.  https://github.com/breck7/scroll/blob/main/blog/programLinks.scroll View the source  Here is a program link to the Scroll web app.  https://try.scroll.pub/#scroll%0A%20%23%20Testing%20Program%20Links%0A%20It%20worked!%0A%20%20style%20color%3Agreen%3B%20font-size%3A%20100px%3B program link  If you click that link you should see "It worked!" in big green text.  Now let's show a complex real world example. The link below contains a 28 line program pasted verbatim from the Ohayo data science studio.  Discovery of the Elements  https://ohayo.computer?filename=test.ohayo&data=doc.title%20Discovery%20of%20the%20Elements%0Adoc.subtitle%20What%20is%20the%20growth%20in%20known%20elements%20over%20time%3F%0Asamples.periodicTable%0A%20hidden%0A%20fill.missing%20Year%201000%0A%20%20hidden%0A%20%20columns.keep%20Element%20Year%0A%20%20%20hidden%0A%20%20%20rows.sortBy%20Year%0A%20%20%20%20hidden%0A%20%20group.by%20Year%0A%20%20%20hidden%0A%20%20%20rows.sortBy%20Year%0A%20%20%20%20hidden%0A%20%20%20%20rows.runningTotal%20count%0A%20%20%20%20%20hidden%0A%20%20%20%20%20vega.bar%20Number%20of%20Elements%20Found%20Each%20Year%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20xColumn%20Year%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20yColumn%20count%0A%20%20%20%20%20vega.line%20Cumulative%20Number%20of%20Elements%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20xColumn%20Year%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20yColumn%20total%0A%20vega.scatter%20Year%20of%20Discovery%20by%20Atomic%20Number%0A%20%20xColumn%20Year%0A%20%20yColumn%20AtomicNumber%0A%20tables.basic%0A%20%20rowDisplayLimit%20200%0Adoc.categories%20chemistry Discovery of the Elements  If you click that link you should see a few data visualizations generated from that program. If you view the source of this page you can see the unaltered program source. Edit the source and the link will update accordingly. Scroll handles the `encodeURIComponent`.  Why not use HTML directly? ========================== Modern browsers do their best to make URLs well-formed and you will notice that they auto encode certain characters like spaces. But by the HTML spec newlines are not a URL code point and generally are stripped and collapsed.  https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-code-points URL code point  https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#strip-and-collapse-ascii-whitespace stripped and collapsed  Program Links in Scroll handle encoding newlines and any other special characters so you can focus on your content and not the encoding. </td>

<td>Counterpoints: A new tool for thought in the Scroll Language ============================================================ by Breck Yunits  https://github.com/breck7 Breck Yunits  Improve your writing by welcoming counterarguments ==================================================  April 13, 2023  There's a tiny new symbol in Scroll today: `!`. The exclamation mark stands for *Counterpoint*. "Counters" aim to help writers strengthen their ideas by encouraging the integration of counterarguments throughout their essays. You can write your own counters or invite counters from friends, LLMs or Internet commenters.  https://scroll.pub/ Scroll  ***  Counterpoints are easy to use: just start a line with `!`. For example:  Humans will eventually establish colonies on Mars.  ! But we haven't colonized the Arctic, 1,000x easier  You can go as deep as you want in countering your own counters!  Humans will eventually establish colonies on Mars.  ! But we haven't colonized the Arctic, 1,000x easier   - Colonizing Mars is 10,000x more valuable  The Benefits of Countering ========================== When we have a lot of terms for a thing, it's usually a hint that it's a valuable thing. And we have a lot of terms for countering. "Steel manning", "red teaming", "playing devil's advocate", to name a few. Countering is a helpful habit that helps clarify your thoughts, understand and empathize with other perspectives, fix logical blunders, hone your pitch, and improve at truth-seeking. Counterpoints in Scroll are in a sense just a reminder to frequently use these techniques.  The Downsides of Countering =========================== Addressing every plausible counter in your main thread can be difficult if not impossible. It can make your writing too verbose and lose reader interest. Counters in Scroll give you a place to record every scattered counter as it comes to you. You can then choose which are important enough to address in your main argument and relegate the rest to the source code (for the very avid reader).  Implementation ============== Counterpoints do not currently appear in the compiled HTML. Instead you only see them during write time. For now, they are just an alternate syntax for comments. But though they perform no new function, like traffic lines, sometimes form is function.  That being said, there are potentially interesting directions this could go in the future, and it would be interesting to hear ideas of what people would like in a v2.  Keep writing, keep thinking! </td>

<td>The Power of Indented Heredocs: Markdown, Textile, and BBCode in one file with no escaping ========================================================================================== by Breck Yunits  https://github.com/breck7 Breck Yunits  August 23, 2021  Scroll is a new language and static site generator that is mostly written in Parsers which are both built on a new syntax called Scroll Notation.  ***  In this demo, I extend Scroll by adding support for Markdown, Textile, and BBCode. I want to demonstrate how easy it is to compose many languages into one using Scroll Notation, which is due to what you might call the Indented or Off-side Heredoc pattern.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown Markdown  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language) Textile  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode BBCode  My implementation is still _researchy_—Parsers still needs a lot of work—but my main point here is to demo how _simple and powerful indented heredocs are_. They allow you to compose unlimited languages in one file in a clean and scalable way. You don't need escaping. I think this is a very helpful pattern you can use in your own languages and code.  Traditional Heredocs ====================  Traditional heredocs use start and end delimiters, like these examples from Ruby and Python and Markdown:  # Heredoc in Ruby puts Scroll Notation is that it is just indented or off-side HereDocs. Or in colloquial academic speak _The Off-Side Rule is all you need_. Most people learn of the off-side rule via Python. Imagine if your whole language was just the off-side rule. That's basically Scroll Notation. But my code is not the important thing—the important thing is this pattern. Try it yourself—I bet you will love it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule Off-Side Rule  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document HereDocs  Extended Examples =================  Markdown ========  Textile =======  BBCode ====== </td>
