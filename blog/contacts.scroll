Imagine a single plain text file named `contacts.scroll` where you stored the contact info for your family, friends, and colleagues, and you could track changes with git, compile it to a beautiful PDF or HTML page with search and sort, and it would also compile to CSV and/or JSON for import into iPhone, Android, Gmail, Outlook, et cetera?

Also imagine that this tool is free, open source, and public domain.

Introducing *Contacts*, a microlanguage (currently 23 lines of code, including comments) that makes it as concise as possible to add, prune, display, print and export your contacts.

There's almost nothing to learn (the code is self-explanatory).

In fact, it's almost guaranteed that using Contacts you will need to write less (we've taken every unnecessary character out).

# Example

code
 ðŸ‘¤ Jack Doe
 phone +1 (555) 123-4567
 email john.doe@example.com
 birthday 2/23/84
 notes Daughter - Samantha.
 
 ðŸ‘¤ Jill Smith
 phone +1 (555) 123-4562
 email jill@gmail.com
 birthday 1/23/80

# How to use

1. Create a file named something like `contacts.scroll` with this content:
code
 // You can import the file, or just copy/paste the 21 lines of code here.
 import [pathToScroll]/microlangs/contacts.parser
 title My Contacts
 buildConcepts contacts.csv contacts.json contacts.tsv
 buildHtml
 gazetteCss

 phone +1 (555) 123-4567
 email john.doe@example.com
 birthday 2/23/84
 notes Daughter - Samantha.
 
 ðŸ‘¤ Jill Smith
 phone +1 (555) 123-4562
 email jill@gmail.com
 birthday 1/23/80

2. Run `scroll build`

Done! You should now see a contacts.html file for display and printing as well as TSV, CSV, and JSON files.

What do you think? Anything that should be added/removed/improved?

# Notes
1. The idea for Contacts was sparked by this tweet from Tyler Tringas.
