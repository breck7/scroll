If you want to make web forms the retarded way, there are many other places to read how to do that.

If you want to learn how geniuses are doing web forms, read on.

# One Field at a Time is Retarded

Building forms for one-field-at-a-time data entry is retarded.

People can't copy/paste your forms. E-receipts are a pain. Auto-form fill works poorly.

It's a huge waste of your users' time that retards them and your business.

And it will always be this way.

# Entire Form in One Field is Genius

Everything becomes radically simpler. People can do things like copy/paste entire applications; email them; version control them; collaborate on them; all effortlessly.

And guess what? You can still also compile to a one-field-at-a-time HTML form and allow users to swap back and forth! It's pure win, no loss.

# You can use this TODAY!

This now ships in Scroll. Here is a test form. You can also see it in use in many of our products.

Because this is new technology, it is not for those that need spoon feeding. Believe it or not, making web forms also used to be complicated.

(If you need this urgently, don't have time to figure it out yourself, and need to hire professional consulting, feel free to get in touch.)

# Don't whine. Build.

I'm tired of reading all the whiners commenting about how our CSS doesn't look so pretty yet, or the tiny little feature you need that isn't supported.

I don't care much to hear from whining losers.

I want to hear from winners. From builders. From those who strive for genius.

Beautiful designs, autoincrement, auto timestamp, joins, decision trees, all that stuff is coming. The world is gonna love this.

If you are a winner, a builder, a genius, join us on GitHub or Reddit.
