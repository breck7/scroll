Scroll is a new language for building HTML and CSV files that powers blogs, websites and knowledge bases.

I often need plain text outputs in addition to HTML files.

I used to make those plain text versions copying and pasting text by hand.

Now Scroll has plain text output built-in.

*

How do I tell Scroll to build plain text files?
===============================================

Add a single line: `buildTxt`

```example.scroll
buildTxt
Hello world.
```

`scroll build` will create `example.txt`. Done!

*

You may want to put `buildTxt` into `header.scroll` or `footer.scroll` to build text files for many pages at once.

*

I've *loved* this new feature in Scroll.

Plain text is a *timeless* way to read, review, and share your thoughts!

Hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
