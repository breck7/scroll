Regardless of what languages you write your programs in, you probably maintain files like _changeLog.txt_ or _releaseNotes.txt_.

Change logs are very helpful for:

- informing your users of new features and bug fixes
- providing detailed technical information to your development team (and open source contributors)
- periodical data analysis for strategic project planning - how fast are we shipping new features? fixing bugs? breaking things?

What if there was 1 language that let you do all 3 things at once?

***

Introducing Changes, a microlang (only 70 lines of code, including comments) that makes it as concise as possible to write, read and analyze change logs.
 https://github.com/breck7/scroll/blob/main/microlangs/changes.parsers

Changes generates a pretty HTML file for your end users; allows for including unlimited detailed technical information for your developers; and generates summary statistics as TSV, CSV, and JSON for your project managers.

***

There's almost nothing to learn (the code is self explanatory).

In fact, it's almost guaranteed that using Changes you will need to write less (we've taken every unnecessary character out).

Example
=======

We use Changes for the Scroll Release Notes.
 https://scroll.pub/blog/../releaseNotes.html

Be sure to check out the source code that generates that HTML.
 https://github.com/breck7/scroll/blob/main/releaseNotes.scroll

***

How to use
==========

1. Install Scroll
npm install -g scroll-cli

2. Create a file names something like `releaseNotes.scroll` with this content:
title My Release Notes
printTitle
buildConcepts releaseNotes.csv releaseNotes.json releaseNotes.tsv
// You can import the changes parsers or just copy/paste the 70 lines into your own file.
import [pathToScroll]/microlangs/changes.parser

thinColumns

üì¶ 0.1.1 7/1/2024
üè• fixed bug in command line app

üì¶ 0.1.0 7/1/2024
üéâ added command line app

endColumns

3. Run `scroll build`

Done! You should now see a `releaseNotes.html` file as well as a TSV, CSV, and JSON file.

What do you think? Anything that should be added/removed/improved?
