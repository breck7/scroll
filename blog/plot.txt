I _engineered on_ many innovative data science tools, including Grapher and Ohayo^engineering.

So I was excited to see Observable launch something new: Plot.

Plot is already great on its own. It handles many of the hard parts of data vis, and it's open source, so we can help them fix the parts that are still a little rough.

But I found a way to take Plot to the next level: I combined it with Scroll.

The Plot/Scroll integration is early, but I can already tell it will evolve into a _very useful_ data science tool.

A Scatterplot with 2 words
==========================

You can now make scatterplots with 2 words.

Obviously you want to add a few more words, but I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that this is the simplest way to generate a scatterplot now and forever will be (until the day when we have mind-reading machines that can generate a scatterplot with zero words).

But enough talk, let's see some code. A tutorial is below.

To follow along, create a new website in 1 second using ScrollHub or install Scroll locally with `npm install -g scroll-cli`.

Step 1: Generate a scatterplot with 2 words
===========================================

Step 2: Add a title
===================

*

Step 3: Add inline data
=======================

*

Step 4: Everything everywhere all at once
=========================================

That's it (for now)!

^engineering: The difference between programming and engineering? It takes programming to make a program that works. It takes engineering to make a program that _barely_ works.
