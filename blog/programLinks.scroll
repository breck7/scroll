Some web apps are designed to load _entire programs_ from a link.

But if a program contain certain characters, such as _newlines_, those links won't work as-is.

To create working links you have to run them through `encodeURIComponent`.

If you are creating blog content by hand this is annoying.

To update a program link you have to keep a copy of the program, update that, then run `encodeURIComponent`, then paste the result into your post.

Today's release of Scroll includes a small new addition that solves this problem. You can call them "Multline Links" or "Program Links".

## Here are two examples

Here is a program link to the Scroll web app.

If you click that link you should see "It worked!" in big green text.

Now let's show a complex real world example. The link below contains a 28 line program pasted verbatim from the Ohayo data science studio.

If you click that link you should see a few data visualizations generated from that program.

Edit the source and the link will update accordingly. Scroll handles the `encodeURIComponent`.

# Why not use HTML directly?
Modern browsers do their best to make URLs well-formed and you will notice that they auto encode certain characters like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Spaces are encoded">spaces</a>.

But by the HTML spec newlines are not a URL code point and generally are stripped and collapsed.
 https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-code-points URL code point
 https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#strip-and-collapse-ascii-whitespace stripped and collapsed

Program Links in Scroll handle encoding newlines and any other special characters so you can focus on your content and not the encoding.
