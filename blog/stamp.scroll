Regardless if you specialize in React, Rails, Django, Next, Java, C#, or ObjectiveC, you probably use _templates_ to start new projects.

Templates generate a handful of files like `readme.md`, `.gitignore`, and `main`.

They also initialize a handful of directories like `src/` and `tests/`.

What if it was even easier to make, edit and use these templates?

***

Introducing Stamp, a microlang (only 60 lines of code, including comments) that makes it as concise as possible to write, edit, share and expand project templates.

# How to use

1. Install Scroll
code
 npm install -g scroll-cli

2. Create `myFirstStamp.scroll`
code
 stamp
  .gitignore
   *.html
  readme.scroll
   # My First Stamp
   <script src="scripts/hello.js"></script>
  scripts/
   hello.js
    console.log("Hello world")

3. Run `scroll build`

Done!

Stamp was jointly created by me and Guillaume Papin. Other tools (listed below) do similar things, but with some slight differences.
