*Scroll's new blink tag lets you call attention to something important*

I am really happy with the current state of Scroll and so grateful for the many people who have helped us get it to this point. That being said, I had a feeling we were missing something important.

*

*So I invented something simple and completely novel*

Introducing the `blink` tag. When you have something important to say and you want to interupt people's lives, use the `blink` tag. It's as easy as this:

```
blink This blinks
```

Advertisers have known for ages that human eyes evolved to respond fast to motion. Now, using my new invention, the `blink` tag, you can bring this innovation from advertising to your products and websites.

*The blink tag, available now in Scroll 34.1.0*

_Note: please don't use this. It's a joke_

Built with Scroll v167.3.0
