If you want to build web forms the traditional way, there are plenty of places you can learn how.

If you want to see how innovators are reimagining web forms, read on.

One Field at a Time Slows You Down
==================================

Designing forms with one-field-at-a-time data entry can create friction.

It makes copying and pasting harder. E-receipts get clunky. Auto-fill features work less effectively.

It slows down your users and limits your business.

And it doesn’t have to be this way.

Entire Form in One Field Unlocks Genius
=======================================

Everything becomes radically simpler. People can copy and paste entire applications, email them, version control them, and collaborate — all effortlessly.

And the best part? You can still compile to a one-field-at-a-time HTML form and let users switch between both modes! It’s pure advantage.

You Can Start Using This TODAY!
===============================

This ships with Scroll. Here's a test form you can try. It's also used across many of our products.

This is new technology, so it’s best suited for those ready to think ahead. Just like web forms themselves once required pioneers.

Builders, Let's Create
======================

While some may focus on minor imperfections or missing features, the real magic is already here for those who see the future.

We’re building for tomorrow — for creators, innovators, and doers.

Beautiful designs, autoincrement, auto timestamping, joins, decision trees — they’re all on the way. The world is going to love this.
