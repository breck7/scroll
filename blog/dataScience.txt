A Tutorial
==========

This tutorial will walk you through how to use Scroll for data analysis and visualization, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

What makes Scroll great for data science?
=========================================
Scroll combines the simplicity of markdown-style syntax with powerful data transformation and visualization capabilities. You can:
- Load data from various sources (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Transform and analyze data with simple commands
- Create beautiful visualizations
- Publish instantly using ScrollHub

- All in a simple, readable format

Let's dive in!

Part 1: Getting Started with Data
=================================

Loading Sample Datasets
=======================

Scroll comes with several sample datasets. Let's start with the famous iris dataset:

sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width,species
6.1,3,4.9,1.8,virginica
5.6,2.7,4.2,1.3,versicolor
5.6,2.8,4.9,2,virginica
6.2,2.8,4.8,1.8,virginica
7.7,3.8,6.7,2.2,virginica
5.3,3.7,1.5,0.2,setosa
6.2,3.4,5.4,2.3,virginica
4.9,2.5,4.5,1.7,virginica
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,setosa
5,3.4,1.5,0.2,setosa

You can also load datasets from Vega's collection:

<style>body
{  font-family: -apple-system
{  max-width: 600px;
{  margin: 40px auto;
{  padding: 20px;
{  line-height: 1.6;

Basic Data Operations
=====================

Let's explore some basic operations on the iris dataset:

name,type,incompleteCount,uniqueCount,count,sum,median,mean,min,max,mode
sepal_length,number,0,8,10,57.699999999999996,5.6,5.77,4.9,7.7,5.6
sepal_width,number,0,8,10,31.599999999999998,3.2,3.1599999999999997,2.5,3.8,2.8
petal_length,number,0,8,10,39.8,4.65,3.9799999999999995,1.4,6.7,4.9
petal_width,number,0,7,10,13.699999999999996,1.75,1.3699999999999997,0.2,2.3,0.2
species,string,0,3,10,null,null,,null,null,virginica

This gives us summary statistics for each column.

Let's look at filtering:

sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width,species
5.3,3.7,1.5,0.2,setosa
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,setosa
5,3.4,1.5,0.2,setosa
sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width,species
6.1,3,4.9,1.8,virginica
5.6,2.8,4.9,2,virginica
6.2,2.8,4.8,1.8,virginica
7.7,3.8,6.7,2.2,virginica
5.3,3.7,1.5,0.2,setosa
6.2,3.4,5.4,2.3,virginica
4.9,2.5,4.5,1.7,virginica
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,setosa
5,3.4,1.5,0.2,setosa

Part 2: Data Visualization
==========================

Basic Plots
===========

Let's start with a simple scatterplot of the iris data:

Line Charts
===========

Let's look at some time series data:

Bar Charts
==========

Let's create a bar chart showing precipitation:

Part 3: Advanced Data Transformations
=====================================

Grouping and Aggregation
========================

Let's look at some more complex transformations:

count,avg_max_temp,avg_min_temp
13,NaN,NaN

Creating New Columns
====================

Let's add some computed columns:

sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width,species,ratio
6.1,3,4.9,1.8,virginica,2.033333333333333
5.6,2.7,4.2,1.3,versicolor,2.074074074074074
6.2,2.8,4.8,1.8,virginica,2.2142857142857144
7.7,3.8,6.7,2.2,virginica,2.0263157894736845

Part 4: Advanced Visualizations
===============================

Heatmaps
========

Let's create a heatmap of annual precipitation values:

Multiple Views
==============

You can create multiple visualizations:
