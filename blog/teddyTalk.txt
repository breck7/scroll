Particles, Scroll, and the Parsers Programming Language
=======================================================

I've recorded a short video (1 minute version; 10 minute version) about our recent work which has begun to eat the software world.

Outline

1. Is this stuff relevant to you?
=================================

Whether you are an experienced, aspiring, or casual programmer, yes.

If you are a writer, yes.

If you are a thinker, yes.

If you are a builder, yes.

If you choose to always remain illiterate to keep your brain different than the crowd, then no. (I applaud your brave creative choice and as a scientist I'm curious to see what happens!)

2. What is Particle Syntax (Particles)?
=======================================

One liner: a syntax-free syntax for splitting files into particles (separated by line breaks) which can have atoms (separated by spaces) and subparticles (indented lines).

 Each line is a particle. Each dot is a atom. Particles lets you easily compare programs and see which one is simpler (less heavy!).

3. What is Scroll?
==================

One liner: Scroll is a language for scientists of all ages where you write and combine particles (written in Particles) to evolve and publish your most intelligence ideas to HTML, PDFs, CSVs, JSON files, movie files, audio files, slideshows, charts, books, et cetera.

 Scroll is a collection of Parsers that allow you to evolve and publish your most intelligent ideas.

4. What is Parsers?
===================

One liner: Parsers is a programming language where programmers write parsers (written in Particles) which consume particles (written in Particles) and also contain logic for translating those particles into actions on computing machines.

 Programmers who understand how computing machines work write Parsers to translate particles into executable machine code.
