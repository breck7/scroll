Scroll Datasets are normal plain text blog posts written in Scroll that also contain structured data and output that data into formats ready for data visualization and analysis tools.

Scroll Datasets are line oriented but represent a table(s). You might call them _deconstructed csvs_ or _deconstructed spreadsheets_.

- Use LLMs to *instantly generate datasets* that are ready for human review and improvement.
- Intermingle structured data with markup to *annotate any and every part of a dataset* while still generating strict tabular files for data analysis tools.
- Put documentation, schema and data all in one (or more) plain text file(s) to easily share, collaborate on, and improve, all *tracked by git for trust*.

# Quick Code Example:

code
 
 This dataset has 2 measures (columns) and 2 concepts (rows).
 
 Documentation, column definitions, rows and *any notes/markup/content* can go in the same file.
 
 # Measures (aka Header, aka Columns, aka Schema)
 
 id: string
 moons: int
 
 # Concepts (aka Rows)
 
 ::
 
 id: mars
 moons: 2
 
 I verified moon count with Google. - BY
 
 ::
 
 id: jupiter
 moons: 63
 
 The moons of Jupiter have their own Wikipedia Page

# The code above generates an HTML page and `demo.csv` that contains this:

code
 id,moons
 mars,2
 jupiter,63

# Overview:
- A dataset consists of 4 atomic elements:
 - measures (think columns or the header row in a CSV)
 - concepts (think rows)
 - values (think values)
 - measurements (concept & measure & value = measurement)

# How to use
- A concept is like a row in a database. Concepts are delimited by `::`.
- Measure definitions must come before the first concept (`::`) and are written like: `appeared: int`
 // A schema is a set of measure definitions. You can think of measures as columns. Measure names (currently) can only contain [a-zA-Z0-9_]. They cannot contain spaces or periods (the period is reserved for nested measures).
- Measurements are done like this `appeared: 2024`

# FAQ
? Isn't the better idea to enhance existing spreadsheet GUIs with LLM generation capabilities?
Almost certainly. Using Scroll for datasets will be much slower and worse than future spreadsheet apps with carefully crafted LLM integrations.

However, it's important to also have simple, lower tech, timeless tools and Scroll Datasets is one of those.

? Can't you do this same thing with YAML and/or Markdown?
Yes! You can easily achieve the same thing as LLMs & Scroll Datasets using LLMs & YAML, or LLMs & YAML & Markdown.
 https://yaml.org/ YAML
 https://github.github.com/gfm/ Markdown

For YAML, just put your documentation and schema in YAML comments up top and then have a tiny script to read that YAML and dump CSV/TSV/JSON or whatever. YAML gives you loads of data structures to use and is widely supported in many languages. But generating HTML from the same file would require more work.

If you want to intermix markup content with your datasets, you can use Markdown to add the marked up content and then have code sections embedding the YAML and a tiny script to parse out those YAML blocks and write your data to disk.

? So, why use Scroll for storing datasets instead of YAML?
Either can do the job. I expect the Scroll design to end up being more ergonomic, but that might not be true or may be unimportant.
 // ergonomic: relating to or designed for efficiency and comfort in the working environment.

If you don't like Scroll's (evolving) version and want to switch it will always be straightforward to automatically refactor to YAML.

? What other related work is out there?
This is a simple pattern to implement, so I'm sure it is likely it has been done a few times before. Please let me know so I can include links to--and learn from--any other prior art.

? What are the advanced features?
- Supports nested measures^roadmap
- Gradual typing in measure definitions^roadmap
- Autojoins across files on ids^roadmap
- Auto generates normalized tables for array measures^roadmap
- Support for text blobs^roadmap
- Support for computed measures^roadmap

? What is the origin of Scroll Datasets?
LLM dataset generation is a _major_ breakthrough in datasets. Scroll Datasets are, at best, a minor improvement. They are designed to work alongside LLMs to help solve the Dataset Needed problem.
 https://breckyunits.com/dataset-needed.html Dataset Needed

Scroll Datasets evolved out of TrueBase. Scroll Datasets have eliminated the need for the TrueBase software (and existing TrueBase sites should be migrated to Scroll Datasets), but were informed by the TrueBase build experience.
 https://truebase.treenotation.org TrueBase

Although Scroll Datasets are designed for a world with LLMs, the design is meant to be useful without them as well, and would also have been mildly useful 30 years ago.

? What were the design goals?
- Have an LLM do the bulk of the work while humans supervise to remove hallucinations.
- Can store everything (documentation, schema, all concepts) in 1 clean plain text file or split into many files (using the `import` keyword).
- The Scroll Dataset syntax balances _looseness_ useful in creative thinking with the _tightness_ needed by tabular data visualization and analysis tools.

? Why are measures and concepts root-level features and not indented?
The normal way to implement this in Scroll would be something like:
code
 measures
  id string
  moons int
 concept
  id mars
  moons 2
 concept
  id jupiter
  moons 63

The flat design was chosen for ergonomic reasons. Datasets seem like they might be useful enough to be worth breaking from Scroll convention a bit. Like all things in Scroll, Datasets are experiment, and maybe this design will evolve.
