<a href="https://scroll.pub">Scroll</a> is a new language and static site generator that is mostly written in <a href="https://sdk.scroll.pub/designer/#standard%20parsers">Parsers</a> which are both built on a new syntax called <a href="https://particles.scroll.pub">Particles</a>.

*

In this demo, I extend Scroll by adding support for Markdown, Textile, and BBCode. I want to demonstrate how easy it is to compose many languages into one using <a href="https://particles.scroll.pub">Particles</a>, which is due to what you might call the Indented or Off-side Heredoc pattern.

My implementation is still _researchy_—<a href="https://sdk.scroll.pub/designer/#standard%20parsers">Parsers</a> still needs a lot of work—but my main point here is to demo how _simple and powerful indented heredocs are_. They allow you to compose unlimited languages in one file in a clean and scalable way. You don't need escaping. I think this is a very helpful pattern you can use in your own languages and code.

Traditional Heredocs
====================

Traditional heredocs use start and end delimiters, like these examples from Ruby and Python and Markdown:

```
# Heredoc in Ruby
puts <<GROCERY_LIST
Grocery list
----
1. Salad mix.
2. Strawberries
GROCERY_LIST
```

```
# Heredoc in Python
print("""
Customer: Not much of a cheese shop is it?
Shopkeeper: Finest in the district , sir.
""")
```

```
```javascript
// A heredoc/code block in Markdown
console.log(123)
```
```

Indented Heredocs
=================

In contrast here is the indented/off-side heredoc pattern in Scroll.

The Demo
========
The code below:

```
markdown
 ### Markdown is best

textile
 *No!* _textile is best_

bbCode
 [u]bbCode rules![/u]
```

Summary
=======

A simple but largely accurate description of <a href="https://particles.scroll.pub">Particles</a> is that it is just indented or off-side HereDocs. Or in colloquial academic speak _The Off-Side Rule is all you need_. Most people learn of the off-side rule via Python. Imagine if your whole language was just the off-side rule. That's basically Particles. But my code is not the important thing—the important thing is this pattern. Try it yourself—I bet you will love it.
