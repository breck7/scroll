The Power of Indented Heredocs: Markdown, Textile, and BBCode in one file with no escaping

Scroll is a new language and static site generator that is mostly written in Grammar which are both built on a new syntax called Scroll Notation.

In this demo, I extend Scroll by adding support for Markdown, Textile, and BBCode. I want to demonstrate how easy it is to compose many languages into one using Scroll Notation, which is due to what you might call the Indented or Off-side Heredoc pattern.

My implementation is still _researchy_—Grammar still needs a lot of work—but my main point here is to demo how _simple and powerful indented heredocs are_. They allow you to compose unlimited languages in one file in a clean and scalable way. You don't need escaping. I think this is a very helpful pattern you can use in your own languages and code.

Traditional Heredocs
====================

Traditional heredocs use start and end delimiters, like these examples from Ruby and Python and Markdown:

# Heredoc in Ruby
puts Scroll Notation is that it is just indented or off-side HereDocs. Or in colloquial academic speak _The Off-Side Rule is all you need_. Most people learn of the off-side rule via Python. Imagine if your whole language was just the off-side rule. That's basically Scroll Notation. But my code is not the important thing—the important thing is this pattern. Try it yourself—I bet you will love it.
