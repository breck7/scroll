* I am really happy with the current state of Scroll and so grateful for the many, many people who have helped us get it to this point, but I have had a feeling that we were missing something important and that's why not a lot of people have paid attention.

blink *So I invented something simple and completely novel*

* Introducing the `blink` tag. When you have something important to say and you want to interupt people's lives, use the `blink` tag. It's as easy as this:

code
 blink This blinks

* Advertisers have known for ages that human eyes evolved to respond fast to motion. Now, using my new invention, the `blink` tag, you can bring this innovation from advertising to your products and websites.
